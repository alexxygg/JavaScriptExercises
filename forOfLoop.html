    <h1>for of Loop</h1>
    <p>
      It makes it easier to iterate, no need for a variable i with a condition
      and a mathemathical operation in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is most commonly used with arrays, but can be used with other types
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time we nest a for of loop inside another, we are accessing the child
      of the parent, if we have a simple array, one for of loop will access each
      array item.
    </p>
    <p>Example with regular for loop and for of loop.</p>

    <h2>Nested for of loop</h2>
    <p>
      If we have an array inside an array, our first for of loop will access
      each individual child array, our second nested for of loop will access the
      individual array items of our child arrays, with the parent array outside
      them.
    </p>
    <p>Example with regular nested for loop and nested for of loop.</p>

    <h2>Strings for of loop</h2>
    <p>We can also use them with strings.</p>
    <p>
      Since the for of loop can be used with other iterable elements, it works
      with strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we are accessing the children of the string, which would be
      individual characters.
    </p>
    <img src="forOfLoopString.png" alt="" />
    <p>So it will console log the characters one by one.</p>

    <h2>Another example</h2>
    <p>
      Here we take an array, access each array item, and make a for of loop to
      console log the squared version of the number.
