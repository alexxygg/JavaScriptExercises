    <h1>Scope</h1>
    <p>It is variable visibility.</p>
    <p>
      Defining a variable in a function, in the open, nested,etc. will affect
      where it can be reached from.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here we have another example, we have a variable with the same name inside
      and outside a function.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we just console log egg outside the function, white will be logged.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we didn't have the outside variable egg defined, we would not be able
      to access the egg variable from the function at all, it would be out of
      scope.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we console log egg from inside the function and only have the outside
      variable for egg defined there, we could access it again, with it's
      corresponding value.
