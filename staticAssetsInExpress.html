    <h1>Static assets in Express.js</h1>
    <p>This refers to CSS and JS scripts that run in the browser.</p>
    <p>
      We need to serve the stylesheets and JS scripts, fonts, images, logos,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>We can do this with express.js!</p>
    <p>app.use(), as we've used before, will run every time.</p>
    <p>We use this method with express.static() inside it.</p>
    <p>We must pass the folder where our files are to this second method.</p>
    <p>
      (We can have multiple folders for each type of file, like one for js and
      one for css, but it is common to have them grouped in a single folder.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we can link our stylesheet in our EJS file, no need for the folder to
      be included, only the file name.
    </p>
    <p>This will apply to every webpage that generates.</p>
    <p>
      In this example we use a folder called public, which inside has our
      app.css stylesheet file!
    </p>
    <img src="staticAssetsStyesheetExpress.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      We can also use the __dirname method to be able to run our server from
      anywhere we are in the file system if using the relative file path.
    </p>

    <h2>Bootstrap + Express JS</h2>
    <hr />
    <h2>EJS and Partials</h2>
    <p>We can use templates inside our templates!</p>
    <p>
      We can include them when needed to not have to write common code again and
      again.
    </p>
    <p>To do this, we use <%- include("partials/head") %></p>
    <p>
      This tag doesn't allow the HTML to escape, it treats any content files as
      a string!
    </p>
    <p>
      (If we had a partial template for the head of an HTML inside a folder
      called partials.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use as many partials as we want in order to reuse code, and save
      time!
