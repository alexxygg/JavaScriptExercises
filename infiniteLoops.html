    <h1>Infinite Loops</h1>
    <p>
      It can cause the computerÂ´s browser to crash, it uses all the memory that
      JS offers because the loop never stops.
    </p>
    <p>An example is a for loops that will never reach its end:</p>
    <p>for(let i = 10; i >= 0; i++)</p>
    <p>
      The code will keep on running as long as the variable is more or equal to
      0.
    </p>
    <p>
      The variable already starts at more than 0, 10. So every time the code
      runs it will add one more, and it will always be true that our variable is
      more than 0.
    </p>
    <p>The code will crash the browser and force quit or close.</p>
    <p>
      We can fix them by thinking logically, and paying attention to our code.
