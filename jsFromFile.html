    <h1>Running JS from a script</h1>
    <p>We first need to create a file ending in .js.</p>
    <p>
      Then, we must link it to our HTML file like with a CSS file, only this
      time it is with the script element, the src or source will be the location
      of the js file in our local computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We added two console.log messages and also created a variable on the js
      file.
    </p>
    <p>Once we opened the console we could see:</p>
    <p>This is visible in the console</p>
    <p>ThatÂ´s it folks!</p>
    <p>We also made the variable:</p>
    <p>let visibleInConsole = 75 + 75;</p>
    <p>Once we entered:</p>
    <p>visibleInConsole;</p>
    <p>We got this:</p>
    <p>150</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      We normally place the script src at the last line before the closing body
      element, in case the browser has trouble loading other things.
