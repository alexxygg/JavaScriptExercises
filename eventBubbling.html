    <h1>Event Bubbling</h1>
    <p>
      When we have multiple events for various HTML elements nested withing one
      another, we can accidentally trigger other events we didn't want to.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>
      If we have a div with a section inside, and that section has a button
      inside:
    </p>
    <p>
      If each of these 3 elements have an onclick event, and we happen to click
      the button, which is the element most deeply nested in the example, we
      will trigger all 3 events!
    </p>
    <div onclick="alert('Alert, div clicked.')">
      Div
      <section onclick="alert('Alert, section clicked.')">
        Section
        <button onclick="alert('Alert, button clicked.')">Click Me.</button>
        Section
      </section>
      Div
    </div>
    <p>
      We may sometimes want an event to bubble, like a wave or chain-reaction.
    </p>
    <img src="eventBubbling.png" alt="" />
    <h2>stopPropagation()</h2>
    <p>
      We can use this method on our event object to make sure the event doesn't
      bubble up, or trigger other events which may be chained to the element.
    </p>
    <p>Here we use the same example:</p>
    <p>Clicking the nested elements will no longer trigger the outer events!</p>
    <p>
      (Since the outer element, our div, would not trigger any events anyway.)
    </p>

    <div onclick="alert('Alert, div clicked.')">
      Div
      <section id="sectionStop" onclick="alert('Alert, section clicked.')">
        Section
        <button id="buttonStop" onclick="alert('Alert, button clicked.')">
          Click Me.
        </button>
        Section
      </section>
      Div
    </div>
    <img src="stopPropagationEventBubblingHTML.png" alt="" />
    <img src="stopPropagationEventBubblingJS.png" alt="" />
    <script src="eventBubbling.js"></script>
  </body>
