    <h1>Nesting COnditions</h1>
    <p>
      We can nest conditions to check for multiple things, that way we can
      provide a different output depending on which conditions were and werenÂ´t
      met.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have made a password prompt for the user, we will be checking for
      multiple conditions, and there will be a success message if all of them
      are met, otherwise, we will specifically tell the user what went wrong.
