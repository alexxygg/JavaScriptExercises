    <h1>Objects</h1>
    <p>They are collections of properties.</p>
    <p>
      We need a variable first followed by an equal sign, and all the properties
      will be inside two curly braces.
    </p>
    <p>It needs a key, a colon and a value.</p>
    <p>Each pair is separated by a comma.</p>
    <p>The pair together is a property.</p>
    <p>
      We can have different types of values, they donÂ´t have to be all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sometimes do not look like objects, like an array, which typeOf tells
      us is an object.
    </p>
    <p>The order of the properties is not important here.</p>

    <p>
      This object has numbers and strings, but it can have arrays or other
      things too.

    <h2>Accesing data from objects</h2>
    <p>
      We can use square brackets with the key in quotes. Like when accesing
      array items.(bracket notation)
    </p>
    <p>
      Or a dot/period followed by the name of the key, no quotes needed.(dot
      notation)
    </p>

    <p>All keys are converted to strings.</p>
    <p>If we use the square brackets version, we can do many more things.</p>
    <p>
      We can call our keys anything we want, like have them start with a number,
      have strings with spaces inside, make our keys variables to access them
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      If our key starts with a number, we can not acces it trhough dot notation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is a simple integer, we can use square brackets without quotes, if
      it is a decimal number, we WILL need quotes.
    </p>
    <h2>Reusing Object Data</h2>
    <p>We can take the values for our keys to make a string:</p>
