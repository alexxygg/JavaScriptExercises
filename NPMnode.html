    <h1>NPM Library</h1>
    <h2>Node Package Manager</h2>
    <p>We can work with packages others have created through npm library.</p>
    <p>It is also a command line tool to install and manage those packages.</p>
    <h2>Installing packages</h2>
    <p>We run npm install followed by the node package in our terminal.</p>
    <p>We must make sure we copy the name of the package correctly.</p>
    <p>We will get all of its dependencies in a folder called node_modules.</p>
    <p>It shouldn't be removed. Neither should package-lock.json</p>
    <p>
      We can then require or import the document, which will have the same name
      as the name of the package we see on npm.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the package's documentation, we will see the options we have, we can
      copy one of the functions and paste it on our index.js file.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can now run it with node in the terminal, making sure we are inside the
      path where our file is located.
    </p>

    <p>THIS WILL INSTALL TO THE LOCAL FOLDER, WHEREVER WE ARE AT.</p>
    <h2>Global packages</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes we may want to access our package from anywhere we are. We can
      do this with global packages.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</h2>
    <p>Every package we install will have a file called package.json.</p>

    <p>It contains data about the module or package we're working with.</p>
    <p>
      It includes its dependencies, and some of them have their own dependencies
      along with their version, sometimes only approximately correct.
    </p>
    <p>We can create one ourselves by running npm init.</p>
    <p>
      It will guide us through the process thanks to its built-in walk-trough.
    </p>
    <p>We will now have a file called package.json inside our folder.</p>

    <p>
      Each new package we install in the same folder will now show up as a
      dependency in the package.json object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its not necessary for the dependency to be there, but it keeps a record of
      everything, and saves it in a shared place.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Installing all dependencies</h2>
    <p>
      We don't tend to include the node_modules file when uploading to git and
      github. It is common to be this way.
    </p>
    <p>This file contains all dependencies.</p>
    <p>We can look in the package.json file and do it manually...</p>
    <p>We can install them by running npm install.</p>
    <p>This will automatically do the process for us.</p>
    <p>
      We should remove useless dependencies from our package.json, that way
      anyone running this command doesn't download dependencies that are not
      needed or necessary.
