    <h1>querySelector</h1>
    <p>This helps us access and select Ids, tag names and class names.</p>
    <p>We will be returned the first match of what we request.</p>
    <p>We must use the CSS syntax:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>("#id")</li>
      <li>("tagName")</li>
      <li>(".class")</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can also access other matches by using ("img:nth-of-type(3)")</p>
    <p>*Example for 4th image match.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Here we have an example.</p>
    <p>Picture 1 has a class of "sky".</p>
    <p>Picture 3 and 5 have a class of "landscape".</p>
    <p>Picture 4 has an id of "airplane"</p>
    <p>We have 7 p elements and 6 img elements.</p>
    <img src="practiceWebsiteQuerySelectorpt1.png" alt="" />
    <img src="practiceWebsiteQuerySelectorpt2.png" alt="" />
    <p>We can access specific ids, elements and classes:</p>
    <img src="querySelector.png" alt="" />
    <p>NTH OF TYPE USED FOR ELEMENTS, NOT IDS OR CLASSES.</p>
    <p>WE WILL GET THE FIRST MATCH FOUND.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>We can also access an element by its attribute.</p>
    <p>Here we have a link, its title is Google.</p>
    <img src="linkQuerySelector.png" alt="" />
    <img src="linkQuerySelectorConsole.png" alt="" />
    <h2>querySelectorAll</h2>
    <p>It returns a collection of matches, instead of the first match.</p>
    <p>
      It will do so in the common Array-like collection of JS objects we've seen
      before!
    </p>
    <img src="querySelectorAll.png" alt="" />
    <hr />
    <p>We can also look for nested elements, with the descendant selector.</p>
    <p>The syntax is simply a space between the parent and child element.</p>
    <p>
      We are on the same webpage as before, there are a total of 10 h2 headings.
    </p>
    <p>But only 3 h2 headings are nested inside an unorganized list.</p>
    <img src="nestedQuerySelectorAllCode.png" alt="" />
    <img src="nestedQuerySelectorAllConsole.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      We can hover over the object from the collection we are returned to see
      where exactly on the page it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also iterate over the returned collection by saving it to a
      variable.
    </p>
    <p>We can access a specific element type like this:</p>
    <p>const checkbox = document.querySelector("input[type=checkbox]")</p>
  </body>
