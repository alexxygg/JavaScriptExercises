    <h1>Destructuring Arrays and Objects</h1>
    <p>
      We can destructure array and objects to assign them specific variable
      names.
    </p>
    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p>Here is an example with an array, combined with spread rest.</p>
    <p>There are 14 items in the original array, which is never modified.</p>
    <p>
      We assign a variable name to the first three, and another to the other 11.
    </p>

    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>
      We can do the same wwith objects. We can do them individually or by
      calling every desired key from the object.
    </p>
    <p>THIS WILL CREATE A VARIABLE WITH THE SAME NAME AS THE KEY.</p>

    <p>If we want to change the variable names, we can do so like this:</p>
    <p>
      THIS MEANS WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE OBJECT KEYS WITH THEIR OBJECT
      NAMES, SINCE WE ARE ONLY CREATING 1 VARIABLE NAME FOR EACH.

    <p>
      If we try to create a variable for a non-existant key, it will just return
      undefined.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it doesn't yet exist, we can give it a value to update the object
      properties.
    </p>

    <p>
      And if we try to give a value to an EXISTING key, it will ignore it, since
      it already will have found a value for the key. No change will occur.
