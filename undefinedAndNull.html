    <h1>null and undefined</h1>
    <p>Also primitive value types.</p>
    <h2>undefined</h2>
    <p>It results when a value is unknown or not defined yet.</p>
    <p>let x;</p>
    <p>
      Here, x is declared, but it does not have a value given, so it is
      undefined.
    </p>
    <p>""Hello"[9];</p>
    <p>
      Here, we are trying to retrieve a value at index 9, but the last index in
      this string is 4. So the result would again be undefined.
    </p>
    <h2>null</h2>
    <p>It is a concept for saying nothing. Just nothingness.</p>
    <p>We can set the value of our variables to null if wanted.</p>
