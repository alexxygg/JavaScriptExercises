    <h1>While Loop</h1>
    <p>While loops will run as long as our conditions are true.</p>
    <p>
      We need to make sure we enter a condition that allows the loop to end
      eventually, or we will have an infinite loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      This condition is entered inside the curly brackets, not the parenthesis
      like with for loops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order in which we place that condition and the output is important, it
      can change the starting and ending point. Everything in between would stay
      the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example, they both do the same thing, but a few tweaks are
      needed for that to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      They will both print:
      40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60
    </p>

    <p>We can do the same with a for loop too.</p>

    <p>
      While loops are mostly not used in this way, for loops are more common.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use them in code where we donÂ´t actually know what is going to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like in a game, we can have a while loop run as long as a variable is not
      true.
    </p>
    <p>while(!gameOver){</p>
    <p>player1Turn;</p>
    <p>player2Turn;</p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p>We do not define a number of times for it to run!</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Here we have an example, this code will keep running until we enter the
      correct key.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the guess is incorrect, it will prompt the user again, as many times as
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once we enter the exact key, we will get a response alert informing
      us the guess was succesful.
