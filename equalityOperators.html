    <h1>Equality Operators</h1>
    <h2>double equals ==</h2>
    <p>
      Checks if two values are equal, but does not check if types are also
      equal.
    </p>
    <p>1==1;</p>
    <p>true</p>
    <p>Here there is no need to convert, as they are the same.</p>
    <p>1=="1"</p>
    <p>
      Here they are first converted to the same type and then compared. This is
      only done when possible.
    </p>
    <h2>Weird cases</h2>
    <p>null == undefined;</p>
    <p>true</p>
    <p>0 == false;</p>
    <p>true</p>
    <p>0 == ""; (empty string)</p>
    <p>true</p>
    <h2>not equal !=</h2>
    <p>
      Checks if two numbers are not equal, again without checking for types.
    </p>
    <p>1 != 2;</p>
    <p>true (YES, They are NOT equal)</p>
    <p>1 != "1";</p>
    <p>false (NO, They ARE equal)</p>
    <h2>tripple equals === (strict equality)</h2>
    <p>
      This one does care about type, it does not do any attempt to change them
      first.
    </p>
    <p>1 === "1";</p>
    <p>false (NO, They are NOT equal)</p>
    <p>0 === false;</p>
    <p>false (NO, They are NOT equal)</p>
    <h2>triple not equal !== (strict inequality)</h2>
    <p>
      This one again checks for inequality for types, no attempt to compare
      different types.
    </p>
    <p>1 !== "1";</p>
    <p>true (YES, They are NOT equal)</p>
    <p>2 !== 2</p>
    <p>false (NO, They ARE equal)</p>
