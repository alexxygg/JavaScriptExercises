    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p>They are an ORDERED collection of values.</p>
    <p>We need square brackets, like when using indexOf.</p>
    <p>Here is an empty array:</p>
    <p>let numbers =[];</p>
    <p>It is an object.</p>
    <p>Here are two with values.</p>
    <p>ler lottoNumbers = [7, 25, 9, 12, 2, 16];</p>
    <p>let products = ["iPhone", "iPad", "iWatch"]</p>
    <p>Since they are ordered, we would have iWatch at index 2.</p>
    <p>Here we have the days of the week in an array called "days".</p>

    <p>
      We can check on our Dev Tools to see the content of the array including at
      which index each item is, and also to see its lenght(The number of items
      it has).
    </p>
    <img src="arrayAsSeenInConsole.png" alt="" />
    <p>We can also see the lenght with:</p>
    <p>days.lenght;</p>
    <img src="daysLenghtConsole.png" alt="" />
    <p>Also we have an empty array:</p>
    <img src="emptyArray.png" alt="" />
    <img src="emptyArrayConsole.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      Here zero means no items, as opposed to the index 0 which is the first
      item of an array.
    </p>
    <p>They can have different types of values too:</p>
