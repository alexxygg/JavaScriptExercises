    <h1>AJAX</h1>
    <h2>Asynchronous JavaScript And XML</h2>
    <p>
      When we are loading new posts on a social media, we don't need to go to
      another webpage, we simply get an infinite scroll type of system.
    </p>
    <p>There's no need to click or move from the site.</p>
    <p>
      Autocompletion and suggestions work the same way, the matches are provided
      by the pageÂ´s server, and requested by the page itself based on the user's
      input.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can fetch all sort of data behind the scenes, all while on the same
      page. Just the bits we need, nothing more, nothing less.
    </p>
    <p>We don't get HTML, CSS or JavaScript, just the data we ask for.</p>
    <h2>API's</h2>
    <p>Web API's are web based.</p>
    <p>
      It is like a portal to another database or software, a way for them to
      communicate between each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      An endpoint is the place where we send the request to, it not a website
      but JSON. What we are returned is not for a user, it is a way to return
      and have our code understand the values we ask for.
    </p>
    <p>Many have a cost, others are free.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Weather data (current,forecasts,etc.)</li>
      <li>Stock market prices</li>
      <li>
        Twitter (Search tweets, post tweets bot, auto-responses to DMs/Post
        mentions)
      </li>
      <li>Facebook, Instagram (Similar to above)</li>
      <li>
        Twilio (Send text messages, whatsapp chat auto-responding, appointment
        reminders,etc.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So sometimes it's not just to fetch data, but to create bots and display
      information.
    </p>
    <p>These API requests and responses work through HTTP requests.</p>
    <p>The format they use is pure data, no events, markup, etc.</p>
    <p>
      The most popular was XML, but they aren't required anymore. It is far less
      common now.
    </p>
    <p>Which is why we may see AJAJ instead, which replaces XML with JSON.</p>
    <h2>JSON</h2>
    <h3>Java Script Object Notation</h3>
    <p>
      It is a format to send information, between browsers, API's, in a
      predictable and simple way.
    </p>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <p>It works like JS objects, but with quotes between the key name.</p>
    <p>
      No undefined, since it would convert it to a string as it doesn't
      recognize it as a type. It becomes invalid JSON if we check with a JSON
      validator.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a built-in method that converts JSON to JS objects, since what we
      are returned are strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can then save the object to a variable and access its keys and values:
    </p>
    <p>JSON.parse(string{})</p>
    <p>We can also do the opposite:</p>
    <p>JSON.stringify(object)</p>
    <h2>Postman</h2>
    <h2>HTTP Verbs</h2>
    <p>
      These are the different options when creating a request, like get for
      example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some APIs only support a certain type of request, o our retrieve of
      information won't work if we don't follow the APIs documentation.
    </p>
    <p>They do different things and they depend on the APIs structure.</p>
    <h2>HTTP Status Codes</h2>
    <p>
      These are the codes that return from an HTTP response, each has a meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      200 is the most common, it means the request succeeded. The ones that
      start with 2 mean success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ones that start with 3 mean something went wrong with the redirection
      of the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ones that start with 4 mean something went wrong on the client side,
      or by the user, like 404 Not found.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ones that start with 5 mean something went wrong on the server side.
