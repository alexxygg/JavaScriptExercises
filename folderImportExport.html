    <h1>Requiring a directory/Folder</h1>
    <p>
      If we want to access parts of different files, we can call them
      individually, and then create a new array with all of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      If all this is done in a file called index.js, we can save it to a
      variable and export it, to be referenced from anywhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      It NEEDS to be named index.js, since when called, node will look for that
      name in the folder.
    </p>
    <p>This is done when using third party libraries.</p>
