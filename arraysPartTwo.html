    <h1>Arrays continuation</h1>
    <p>We can access an array item with:</p>
    <p>days[0];</p>
    <p>This will show us index 0 of our array days.</p>
    <p>RESULTS IN --> "Monday"</p>
    <p>
      (days = [ "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday",
      "Saturday", "Sunday", ];)
    </p>
    <p>We can access a specific index of an array index too.</p>
    <p>days[0][0];</p>
    <p>RESULTS IN --> "M"</p>
    <p>We can change an index of an array index if needed.</p>
    <p>
      THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE when working with a string. We can access the
      specific index of our string, but not modify it.
    </p>
    <p>We made an array called colors.</p>
    <p>let colors = ["redd","oranje","green"]</p>
    <p>Two of our items are mispelled, we can update their values like this:</p>
    <img src="fixingArrayItems.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      We can change an item to another type too, like to a number or boolean.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      We can create new array items and place them wherever we want, even if it
      is not right after our last defined index item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we have created a new index item for our array colors, it is at index
      6.
    </p>
    <p>We only had 3 items before, so the last index filled was 2.</p>
    <p>Now, all array indexes between 2 and 6 are empty:</p>
    <img src="emptyArrayIndexes.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      They show as undefined, since no value has been given to them, but they
      canÂ´t just not exist since we defined a value for index 6 already!
    </p>
    <p>Here we update an item, and also change another one.</p>
