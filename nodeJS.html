    <h1>node JS</h1>
    <p>It is a JS runtime,</p>
    <p>
      Its a JS implementation we can run outside our browser, which allows us to
      do many things.
    </p>
    <p>We use the same syntax as vanilla JS.</p>
    <p>
      The first server side implementation was created 13 years before node.js
    </p>
    <p>It is the most popular of any available JS.</p>
    <h3>Uses</h3>
    <p>We can create applications.</p>
    <p>We can create web servers.</p>
    <p>We can create command line tools. (In the terminal).</p>
    <p>
      We can create native applications. (Like VS Code and Slack through
      Electron).
    </p>
    <p>We can create games.</p>
    <p>We can create drone software.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Netflix, Uber, even NASA uses node.js</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Execute)</h2>
    <p>
      The Node.js REPL is basically the JavaScript console running in our
      terminal, we can use any JS code we want.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is used to debug, play around and test things, it works like a sandbox
      just waiting for our input to evaluate and run it.
    </p>
    <p>
      .help gives us some tips for commands, not accessible in the regular JS
      console.
    </p>
    <p>Ctrl + D will also exit node.</p>
    <p>
      The window or global top level object isn't available in node. Instead,
      global gets us to the window.
    </p>
    <p>Neither is DOM manipulation, since Document isn't available either.</p>
    <h2>Running node files</h2>
    <p>
      We don't use node.js to write our code, just like we wouldn't use the web
      console either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we have a js file, we must cd into the folder where our file is
      located.
    </p>
    <p>
      (IF NOT IN THE FOLDER WHERE OUR FILE IS, WE MUST SPECIFY THE RELATIVE PATH
      WHERE THE FILE IS TO RUN SUCCESSFULLY.)
    </p>
    <p>We can then run : node file.js.</p>
    <p>
      This will execute the code inside our js file without the need to sync it
      to an HTML file.
    </p>

    <p>
      SO node WILL OPEN THE REPL/CONSOLE AND node file.js WILL RUN THE FILE
      INSIDE THE TERMINAL.
    </p>

    <h2>process.argv</h2>
    <p>
      This built-in node method will return the first 2 paths of where the node
      file is.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can eliminate the first 2 strings returned and add our own arguments,
      her we use this with a for of loop.
