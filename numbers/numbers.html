    <h1>Numbers</h1>
    <p>They are a primitive type of value in JS.</p>
    <p>There are decimal numbers, integers, fractions, negatives, etc.</p>
    <p>We can add, subtract, multiply, divide, get remainders, etc.</p>
    <p>2, -2, 2.568</p>
    <p>1+2, 2-2, 3*7, 8/3, 8%2.</p>
    <h2>Power of **</h2>
    <p>
      The power of symbol helps us multiple a number to the power of another
      number.
    </p>
    <p>7 ** 3 is the same as 7 * 7 * 7</p>
    <p>8 ** 4 is the same as 8 * 8 * 8 * 8</p>
    <h2>Operations (PEMDAS)</h2>
    <p>
      When multiple operations are expected, it will go by importance, which is
      parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition and
      subtraction.
    </p>
    <p>This: 4+5*6 is the same as 4+(5*6)</p>
    <p>4 + 3 * 4 / 2 is the same as 4 + ((3 * 4)/2) = 10</p>
    <p>(13 % 5) ** 2 is equal to (3) ** 2 = 9.</p>
    <h2>Remainders</h2>
    <p>
      The percentage symbol helps us do operations as remainders. They help to
      determine if a number is even or odd in some ways.
    </p>
    <p>All these result in 1 :</p>
    <p>25489%2, 323%2, 45677%2</p>
    <p>The numbers can be divided by 2 and have 1 left over.</p>
    <p>All these result in 0 :</p>
    <p>25488%2, 324%2, 45678%2</p>
    <p>The numbers can be divided by 2 exactly.</p>
    <h2>NaN</h2>
    <p>Not a Number:</p>
    <p>0 divided by zero is an example.</p>
    <p>1 + NaN is also NaN.</p>
    <p>200 + 0/0 is also NaN.</p>
    <p>
      We can not do any math with NaN, anything you multiple, add to a NaN will
      result in NaN.
    </p>
    <h2>typeof</h2>
    <p>typeof helps us know what something is.</p>
    <p>typeof NaN = number</p>
