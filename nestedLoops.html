    <h1>Nested Loops</h1>
    <p>We cna nest a loop inside of another loop.</p>
    <p>First, our original loop will run once.</p>
    <p>Then, our nested loop will run UNTIL THE EXPRESSION IS FALSE.</p>
    <p>
      We will end up with an output for our original loop, and ans many outputs
      for our second loop as long as they are TRUE. This will happen every time
      until our ORIGINAL LOOP IS FALSE.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <img src="nestedLoopsCode.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      The first loop will run once every time, right after, the second nested
      loop will run 3 times. (Since it starts at 2, it will be true when it is
      2,3 and 4. 5 would no longer be less than the lenght, which is also 5.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It will do this every time, 5 in total. (Since our first loop is true when
      i equals to 0,1,2,3 and 4.)

    <hr />
    <p>We can use nested loops to work with nested arrays, as commonly done.</p>
    <p>
      We have an array with 7 subarrays. They are all fruits, grouped by the
      letter they start with.
    </p>
    <p>We also have a nested loop inside a loop.</p>

    <h2>Another example:</h2>
    <p>Here we have an array with 4 subarrays.</p>
    <p>They are groups of animals, organized by relative sizes.</p>
