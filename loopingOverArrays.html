    <h1>Looping over arrays</h1>
    <p>
      We can also use our for loop to work with data structures, like arrays for
      example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we made an array of the top 150 most frequently written words in
      English.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will use a loop to console.log the index of each word, followed by the
      value of the array index or word itself.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      We give our variable i an initial value of 0, that way we can match it
      with our first index, index 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ask it to check if i is less than the lenght of our variable
      top150EnglishWords, we donÂ´t use less than or equal to this time, only
      less than. The reason is that the lenght is one more than the last index,
      so we would print one saying: 150, undefined. (The last array item of the
      150 words has an index of 149)
    </p>
    <p>
      And we increase our variable by 1 each time until we reach 149, 1 less
      than the lenght of the array, 150.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, we console log both the variable value, which is a match to the
      index of each array item, followed by the specific array item in our words
      variable that matches that number. (If at 5, the number 5 and the item at
      index 5. variableName[5];)

    <h2>Reversed</h2>
    <p>
      We set the initial variable i to the number that matches the last index.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively in the second example we use the lenght of our words
      variable - 1, since the lenght is 150 and our last index is 149.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, set the condition: as long as i more than or equal to 0...(equal is
      used to make sure we include the first index item at index 0)
    </p>
    <p>i -- just substracts one from our intial variable.</p>
    <p>Lastly, we print the index matching number and the array item again.</p>

    <p>Another example:</p>
    <p>
      Here we print each index, but convert it to uppercase first. We run
      through every available item in the array, then stop.
