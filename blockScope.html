    <h1>Block scope</h1>
    <p>
      A block is what's inside the curlt braces of things like conditionals
      statements, loops, etc. Scope in a block works differently than with a
      function.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can not access any variable declared in a block, unless we are calling
      it from inside the block. if we try, we will get an error saying that the
      variable is not defined.
    </p>
    <p>We can still access universal variables, which are outside blocks.</p>

    <h2>var</h2>
    <p>
      If we declare our variables with var instead of let or const, we actually
      have scope even outside the blocks where they were declared!
    </p>
    <p>
      let and const block scopes them from anywhere, even after they have been
      used we can see their values!
