    <h1>if() Conditional</h1>
    <p>The if conditional helps us make decisions.</p>
    <p>LetÂ´s say we declare a variable:</p>
    <p>let stars = 5;</p>
    <p>We can now use the if conditional to make a decision.</p>
    <p>Here it is:</p>
    <p>if(stars === 5){</p>
    <p>("You have 5 stars.");</p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p>In the console we would see:</p>
    <p>You have 5 stars.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      If the code above was false, anything inside the curly braces would not
      run.
    </p>
    <p>
      We added two console.log message, one before and one after the if
      conditional statement, those will run regardless.
    </p>
    <h2>random example</h2>
    <p>let random = Math.random();</p>
    <p>if (random > 0.5) {</p>
    <p>console.log("If you can see this, your number was more than 0.5!");</p>
    <p>console.log(random);</p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p>Succesful attempt:</p>
    <p>If you can see this, your number was more than 0.5!</p>
    <p>0.7659067413046483</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      We could add another if conditional for when the number is less than 0.5.
      But there are easier ways to do so...
    </p>
    <h2>Check if a number is even or odd</h2>
    <p>First we need to make a variable for a random number:</p>
    <p>let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random()*100)+1;</p>
    <p>We can get any number including and between 1 and 100.</p>
    <p>
      Next we need to make an if condition. Inside it we will check to see if
      the number is divisible by 2 with the remainder operand:
    </p>
    <p>if(random %2 ===0){</p>
    <p>console.log("The number is even!");</p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p>
      So if the number can not be divided by 2, we know it is odd, and no
      message will display.
