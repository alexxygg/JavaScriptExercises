    <h1>Logical Operator OR ||</h1>
    <p>
      This operator checks to see if at least one of the sides is true, it
      doesn´t have to be all of them, a single one is enough.
    </p>
    <p>It is represented with two pipe symbols.</p>
    <h2>true || true;</h2>
    <p>true</p>
    <h2>true || false; / false || true;</h2>
    <p>true</p>
    <h2>false || false;</h2>
    <p>false</p>

      We will check for a theme park´s prices with the AND and also with the OR
      logical operator.

      With the first example we used the AND logical operator, it was more
      specific with the alerts, but longer in code.

      We were able to put together the 2 age groups that can come in for free
      using the OR logical operator.

    <h1>COMBING AND with OR</h1>

      To make sure no age entered is invalid, we can make sure negative numbers
      are not included in our logic limits.

      It is important to know that the AND operator runs before the OR operator,
      so parenthesis can help with that, in this case they were not necessary
      but included for visual understanding in the first condition where both
      AND and OR were in the same expression.
    </p>
    <p>If we had OR first, and then AND, the code would still run AND first!</p>
