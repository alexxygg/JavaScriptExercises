    <h1>addEventListener</h1>
    <p>
      We can use event listeners to pass in 2 arguments, the first is what we
      are listening for, and the second is the action or callback we want to run
      when this happens.
    </p>
    <img src="addEventListener.png" alt="" />
    <p></p>
    <button class="btn1">Click Me!</button>
    <p>This approach allows us to run multiple callbacks on the same event.</p>
    <p>
      WE COULD NOT RUN 2 FUNCTIONS ON THE SAME EVENT BECAUSE THE SECOND WOULD
      OVERRIDE THE FIRST, LIKE WHEN A CSS STYLE IS DECLARED AT THE END COMPARED
      TO ONE DECLARED BEFORE IT.(Unless we have both actions declared in a
      single function.)
    </p>
    <p>With addEventListener we CAN include 2 or more functions.</p>
    <p>There's more flexibility this way, and is much more commonly used.</p>

    <button id="hello">Hello</button>
    <button id="goodbye">Goodbye</button>
