    <h1>Web API'S and JS being Single Threaded</h1>
    <p>
      JS only has one thread, meaning it can not multi-task, only switch between
      tasks.
    </p>
    <p>It only works in one thing at the time.</p>
    <p>When we use a setTimeout function, the browser helps us.</p>
    <p>
      Browsers come with Web API's that can handle certain tasks in the
      background
    </p>
    <p>
      The JS call stack recognizes these API functions and passes them off to
      the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's as if JS asked the browser for a reminder to do a certain task after
      certain time, while it does other things to keep productivity at peak.
