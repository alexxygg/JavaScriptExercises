    <h1>else</h1>
    <p>
      It is the last piece of an if conditional, it is not obligatory to
      include. It would follow if and else if.
    </p>
    <p>
      The else statement doesn´t need parenthesis, only an opening and closing
      curly brace where the action we want will go.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have made a prompt for the user to enter one of three valid options,
      rock, paper or scissors.
    </p>

    <p>
      We used the .toLowerCase() to make sure whatever the user enters, it is
      converted to lower case. If the user enters ROCK PaPeR or sciSSors, we
      will still be able to compare it with our expected values.(which we placed
      in our conditionals in lowercase.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We could´ve used toUpperCase() and set our expected values in capital
      letters too.

    <p>
      In the case that the user does not enter one of the 3 options, an alert
      will appear saying to enter a valid option.

    <h2>Another example</h2>
    <p>
      Here we have a random number generated between and including 1 and 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the number is 5 or less, there will be one message, if it is more than
      5, there will be another.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both cases, the number will be shown in the console. We placed that
      code outside the braces, it is a better practice, rather than to have
      placed the code inside both conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no need to add the second condition about the number being 5 or
      less, since half of the opptions have already been covered with the
      conditional we DID declare.
    </p>

    <h2>Another One</h2>
    <p>
      Here we are deciding what will be logged to the console based on a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are using all 3 conditionals in the correct order: if, if else and
      else.
