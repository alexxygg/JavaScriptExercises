    <h1>...spread</h1>
    <p>Spread helps us so many things.</p>
    <p>
      The syntax for spread is 3 periods or dots before the array that was
      passed in to the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use it to pass in an array into a function that doesn't accept
      arrays, since we would get NaN if not including it. This Math function
      needs individual arguments, an array would be passed into the function as
      a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      With spread, it takes each item and analyzes it, comparing with all the
      other items.

    <p>
      We can use it with console.log too. Here we see the same array, also a
      string.
    </p>
    <p>
      The array would normally be logged as an array again. The spread version
      is converted to a string.
    </p>
    <p>
      The string is just a logged string, but if spread, it will take each
      character and spread it.
