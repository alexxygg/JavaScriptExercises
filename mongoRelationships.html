    <h1>Mongo Relationships</h1>
    <p>
      Relationships between data are the different entities we store in a
      database that are connected in one way or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      A website for social media may have a user's friends in one entity, its
      profile pictures and posts in another, and comments and likes in yet
      another one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although they are separate entities, they are all in the same database,
      interconnected in ways to always have the data available.
    </p>
    <h2>In SQL</h2>
    <p>
      In SQL, the data is stored in isolated tables, where strict schemas are
      needed. Each table can be connected and accesses by another one by inking
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single or multiple aspect of each table can be referenced in order to
      avoid duplication.
    </p>
    <p>There are many ways to do this:</p>
    <ul>
      <h3>One to Many</h3>
      <li>We can have a single user with many posts.</li>
      <h3>Many to Many</h3>
      <li>
        We can have a single movie, with many actors, while also a single actor
        who has been in many movies.
        <ul>
          <p></p>
          <li>
            In this case, the linking table would reference a movie's name id
            with each participating actor's name id.
          </li>
          <li>
            Or the actor's name id with the name id of every movie he has been
            in.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's like copying and pasting the information in order to avoid
            duplicating all the data multiple times.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>In MongoDB (non-SQL)</h2>
    <p>
      Since MongoDB does not follow the same pattern/infrastructure as SQL
      database, we do this linking/referencing in alternate ways.
    </p>
    <p>There are many structuring options for our data.</p>
    <p>
      Depending on how much data we're working with, it may be wise to choose
      different approaches for information storing.
    </p>
    <h3>One to Few</h3>
    <p>
      A user with a few addresses, like in Amazon, Uber Eats. It's cery unlikely
      to have thousands of addresses. There's no need to separate them to their
      own collection or model.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should consider if we need to access an address without the user, if we
      would ever need to access all of them at the same time, etc.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <p>
      We create a schema, with one of the keys having an array of keys and
      values as its value.
    </p>
    <p>
      BY default, this embedded array will generate its own _id, which we can
      prevent as seen in the code.
    </p>

    <p>Here we use our schema to create a new user.</p>
    <img src="oneToFewMongoRelationshipCreateUser.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      And here we make a function to add a new address to the array designated
      for addresses.
    </p>
    <img src="oneToFewMongoRelationshipAddNewAddress.png" alt="" />
    <h3>One to Many</h3>
    <p>This is our approach for a medium amount of data.</p>
    <p>
      We will use an object id in the parent object as a reference to the other
      objects in order to reference them. It can be another key instead too.
