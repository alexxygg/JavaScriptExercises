    <h1>Higher order Functions</h1>
    <p>
      They help us use functions as arguments for other functions, and to return
      functions from the function itself.
    </p>
    <h2>A function as an argument.</h2>

    <p>Fiest we create a function that works on it's own.</p>
    <p>
      Then we create a second function, we will tell it to expect a fuunction as
      an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parameter can be anything, we will let it know that the parameter is a
      function on the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we tell it to run the function 10 times. The function we entered is
      the first one, so it will console log a random number between 1 and 20,
      ten times.
    </p>

    <p>
      And here are 3 times we ran the code in the console, the output is
      different each time.

    <img src="functionAsArgumentConsole3.png" alt="" />
    <h2>Returning functions as values</h2>
    <p>
      We can also get a function back depending on the arguments we give it, we
      can later save the new function into a variable with different arguments
      each time, and name it accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This function checks if num is between 50 and 100, it will only check if
      it is between those numbers, BUT...
    </p>

    <p>
      We can make our own function too, with placeholders, we can change the
      placeholders to specific values later, when we save the modified function
      to a variable.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Here we have a template, the min and max can be changed to fit our needs.
    </p>
    <img src="testBetweenTemplateCode.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      Here in the console, we made some changes to those parameters, to adapt to
      what we were trying to check.
    </p>
    <img src="testBetweenConsoleFunctions.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      areYouAlive checks if the age we enter is between 1 and 112, since that is
      the age of the oldest person at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      legallyNOtAnAdult will check if your age is between 1 and 17, 18 or more
      will be true.
    </p>
    <p>And same for the other example.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Here we set up 2 passwords, and check if the user enters either one, if
      not exactly one of them, it will not grant access.
    </p>
    <img src="test1of2PasswordsTemplateCode.png" alt="" />
    <p>We made some to make sure they worked, even with strings.</p>
    <img src="test1of2PasswordsConsoleFunctions.png" alt="" />
    <hr />
    <p>
      And finally, this function, which return a function we can use to check if
      a user's username and password match the one we have in the system, if not
      true, we will not let the person access.
