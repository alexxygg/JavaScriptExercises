    <h1>Module exports</h1>
    <p>
      When working with node js, we can call another js document and reference
      it on our new js document.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing that will be imported is what we explicitly exported in the
      original js file we are referencing.
    </p>
    <p>This is done with module.exports</p>
    <p>
      The default is an object, but if we were to set the export to a string or
      a number, that would be all we would have access to from our new js file.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <h3>Code we are exporting:</h3>
    <p>
      ***We must return what we expect if using curly brackets for our
      functions, unless it is a one-liner.

    <p>Examples:(EXPORTING from desired file)</p>

    <img src="moduleExport.png" alt="" />
    <p>Shorthand</p>
    <p>
      (WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE EXPORTS'S VALUE DOESN'T CHANGE, AS IT WOULD AFFECT
      THE EXPORT)
    </p>

    <p>Examples:(IMPORTING to desired file)</p>
    <img src="modulesImportFromFile.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      If the path is not local, we must specify exactly where our referenced
      file is located.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>We can also import from an object we create:</p>
    <img src="moduleExportObject.png" alt="" />
    <p></p>
    <img src="modulesImportFromObject.png" alt="" />
    <hr />
    <p>Or even call only specific functions:</p>
    <p>
      We can call them without the math constant name, since it has been
      removed.
    </p>
    <img src="moduleImportingOnlySpecificFunctions.png" alt="" />
    <hr />
    <p>And we can even export at the time we declare a function or variable:</p>
