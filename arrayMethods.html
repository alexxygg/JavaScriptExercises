    <h1>Array Methods</h1>
    <p>
      There are many built-in array methods. Like the ones we have used with
      strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      They need parenthesis just like others we´ve seen.(indexOf(),toUpperCase()
      etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      IT IS IMPORTANT to notice that when we use a method on a string, the value
      we are returned is not the same string, but updated. The original string
      will still have the same values exactly as before, we only get a returned
      string to be used if we need, or to be stores in a NEW variable.
    </p>
    <p>With array methods, we ARE changing the original item!!!</p>
    <h1>.push() and .pop()</h1>
    <p>
      They work like a stack, we are adding and removing items from the END of
      the array.
    </p>
    <h2>.push()</h2>
    <p>Helps add an item to end of array</p>

    <p>
      We can add multiple items at the same time, just separated by a comma.
    </p>

    <h2>.pop()</h2>
    <p>Helps remove an item from the end of the array.</p>
    <p>
      This method doesn´t need an argument or value, since it will simply remove
      the last existing array item.
    </p>
    <p>We can save the removed value in a variable.</p>
    <p>Our current array names2 has "Howard" at the end.</p>
    <p>
      Here we are removing him and saving him on a new variable at the same
      time.
    </p>

    <h1>.shift() and .unshift()</h1>
    <p>We are adding and removing items from the BEGINNING of the array.</p>
    <h2>.shift()</h2>
    <p>Helps remove an item from the beginning of the array.</p>
    <p>
      We can use it without entering a value or argument, since we are just
      removing the first array item.
    </p>

    <h2>.unshift()</h2>
    <p>Helps add an item to the beginning of an array</p>
    <p>Like a VIP pass, straight to the front!</p>

    <h2>ALL TOGETHER NOW!</h2>

    <h2>And then some... more practice</h2>
    <p>
      Here we made some errors, corrected them, and then added them to their
      correct place, (alphabetical order).
