    <h1>More Array Methods</h1>
    <h2>.concat()</h2>
    <p>
      This method helps us combine two arrays,the array we pass in the method
      will then be in a new array after the last item of the first array we used
      concat on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original 2 arrays will not be changed, as if working with a string,
      but we can save the resulting array in a variable if wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we had 2 arrays; americanCities and europeanCities. After using
      .concat() we have 3, since we saved the result of the method to
      worldCities.

    <h2>.includes()</h2>
    <p>It is a boolean method, it will return true or false.</p>
    <p>It checks to see if the argument we enter is part of our array.</p>
    <p>
      We have to type what we are looking for exactly as it would be named,
      otherwise it will return false.
    </p>

    <h2>.indexOf()</h2>
    <p>It works like when using it with a string.</p>
    <p>
      We can check if an item is in an array by entering its name as an
      argument, it will return the index of the item.
    </p>
    <p>Spelling is important here too.</p>
    <p>If the item does not exist in the array, it will return -1.</p>
    <p>
      If there are multiple items with the same name, IT WILL RETUTN THE INDEX
      OF THE FIRST MATCH, not of every single match.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a reminder of the string version of the method and right after the
      array version.

    <h2>.reverse()</h2>
    <p>It is destructive, meaning it changes the original array.</p>
    <p>
      There is no need to enter an argument, all it will do is take all the
      items and switch the order in reverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we see that the original array is different after running the method.
