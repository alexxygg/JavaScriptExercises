    <h1>REST</h1>
    <p>Representational State Transfer</p>
    <p>
      It is a set of guidelines, ideas and principles for how clients and
      servers communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want a CRUD application, (Create, Read, Update, Delete), we must
      have ways of doing all this within the application.
    </p>
    <p>A RESTful website like Twitter has all the CRUD options.</p>
    <p>
      They have a uniform interface, a consistent URL pattern matches with HTTP
      verbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can send a post, get, update or delete HTTP request to Create, Read,
      Update and Delete!
    </p>
    <h2>RESTful Comments</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>UUID Package</h2>
    <p>
      When something is not hardcoded, and we are expecting a value to return,
    </p>
    <p>
      UUID helps us generate unique universal id's, the section v4 helps us as
      long as we install and require it in our file.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>Our browser can only send GET and POST requests.</p>
    <p>
      We can override this by installing npm i method-override and using it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can send a header in the request to have it treated in another way.
    </p>
    <p>Also with a query value.</p>
