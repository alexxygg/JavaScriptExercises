    <title>HTTP Cookies</title>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      HTTP cookies are ways to track user data, there has been much legislation
      regarding them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are bits of information we can store in a user's browser, associated
      to specific webpages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user's browser sees them in future visits. Otherwise, there would be
      no history of if someone had ever visited our page before. It can be used
      to remember a user's shopping cart, dark mode preferences and many other
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      It helps us show relevant content and offer a more personal experience. No
      need to ask every single time for these details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most importantly, they are used for tracking, since many webpages sell
      user information for publicity reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are unique identifiers that can tell any two user's apart. THese name
      and value pairs show things like last access date.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should use them for ethical things, such as knowing if a user is logged
      in, where they are logging in from (For security reasons and user account
      protection. ), etc.
    </p>
    <h2>Sending cookies</h2>
    <p>
      To send a cookie, we must use the cookie() method on our response
      argument/object.
    </p>
    <p>It will take two arguments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first for the name we want to assign the key in our cookie key value
        pair.
      </li>
      <li>The second for the value of our value counterpart.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a new value is added to our key, the old one will be replaced.</p>
    <p>
      We can see all cookies from the browser's Dev Tools or by making a request
      with an API tool like Postman and viewing the cookies section.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also specify additional things to configure and control them
      better, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A domain name.</li>
      <li>We can encode our cookies.</li>
      <li>Set an expiration date. a</li>
      <li>
        Set a maxAge (a time limit based on the time the cookie is sent for the
        first time. i.e: A year from now.).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      And we can include as many cookies as we want in a specific request path.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookie Parser Middleware</h2>
    <p>
      If we want to use the stored cookie data, we can find it in req.cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since a lot of application don't make use of cookies, the parser package
      we need to do this is not installed by default.
    </p>
    <p>We can install it with npm i cookie-parser.</p>
    <p>
      We must save it to a variable by requiring it, and declare an app.use()
      with the function being executed inside it.
    </p>
    <p>Now we can access to req.cookies.</p>
    <p>
      If we were to console log req.cookies, we would see an object with every
      key value pair of cookies.
    </p>
    <img src="cookieParserReqDotCookies.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      We can use them in a string template literal for a more personal
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we destructure req.cookies and make use of 2 of the key's values.
    </p>
    <p>(In case name is empty, we have set a default value of 'Anonymous')</p>
    <img src="usingSlashAccessingReqDotCookies.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      We could close the browser and reopen it, and we would still have access
      to that data, since it is stored in a local file on the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This does not work across browsers, which is why we should not store
      important information in cookies.
    </p>
    <h2>Signing Cookies</h2>
    <p>Signed cookies include a digital/cryptograhic signature.</p>
    <p>We use it to verify if there has been any changes.</p>
    <p>It's like a broken seal in a food product.</p>
    <p>
      The cookie parser signs it, and sends a weirder looking version of it to
      the client. Then, that signed version is sent back like a regular cookie.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the server side we can tell if they are the same values sent, or if
      they've been modified in any way, if it has been compromised or if it is
      still the same.
    </p>
    <h2>Sending signed cookies and retrieving their data</h2>
    <p>
      To do the cookie signing, we must pass in a "secret" to our
      app.use(cookieParser()).
    </p>
    <p>
      This "secret" is simply a string we can make up, although in the real
      world it would be much more secure and hidden from view, we would need to
      take special security measures to assure this.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must also include a third argument in our res.cookie(), so other than
      the key name and value, we must add { signed: true }.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting cookie value, which is different from a non-signed cookie
      with the same value, will have the value somewhere in it. The point is not
      to hide the value, but to verify the integrity/validity, that it hasn't
      changed or been tampered with!
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing to notice is that the key and value of our signed cookie would
      not show if we were to console log req.cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      To view it, we would need to change it for req.signedCookies, which only
      works if we have our parser installed, and we included a "secret" in our
      app.use(). This is to make a clear distinction between the cookie types.
    </p>
    <p>
      If for any reason we were to change the cookie value in the Dev Tools, or
      through an API tool, we again would not see the key value pair, even if
      console logging req.signedCookies.
    </p>
    <p>This is because the cookie-parser failed to verify the cookie.</p>

    <h2>HMAC signing</h2>
    <p>HMAC stands for Hash Message Authentication Code.</p>
    <p>
      This is the method used to compare the original key value with whatever
      the current one is. It also takes into account the secret key to try to
      recreate a code and compare it with the original code. It does this by
      calling a function.
    </p>
    <p>If they don't match, we know it was changed.</p>
