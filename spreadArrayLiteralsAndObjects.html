    <h1>...spread Array Literals</h1>
    <p>We can also use the spread method with array literals.</p>
    <p>
      The order in which we call the spread array is important, as that will be
      the way it will be ordered in the new array.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original arrays are not changes, we are basically taking a copy of the
      array we spread for our new array.
    </p>
    <p>We can also add items on top of the spread arrays.</p>

    <p>
      And similarly, we can spread an array item into a new array, where every
      character of the item is a new item of a new array.

    <h1>...spread Objects</h1>
    <p>We can copy, tweak, combine object properties, etc.</p>

    <p>
      IF THERE IS A CONFLICT, LIKE A SAME KEY WITH A DIFFERENT VALUE FOR EACH
      OBJECT'S PROPERTIES, THE LAST ONE TO BE SPREAD WILL KEEP ITS VALUE!
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, both xx and yy have a color key, but only yellow is seen
      once both objects are combined into the new one, blue is just eliminated.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can use this to retrieve user info from a form, and add our own info to
      a new object, like assigning a unique ID for each user for quick access to
      his/her information, or granting special permissions.
