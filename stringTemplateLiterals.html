    <h1>String Templates</h1>
    <p>There are multiple ways to make templates for our strings.</p>
    <p>
      Here we have a few variables, they represent different types of amounts
      and information.
    </p>
    <p>let eggPrice = .20;</p>
    <p>let eggsBought = 36;</p>
    <p>
      let summary = "You bought " + eggsBought + " eggs for a total of $" +
      eggPrice * eggsBought + " dollars!"
    </p>
    <p>RESULTS IN --> 'You bought 36 eggs for a total of $7.2 dollars!'</p>
    <h2>Template literals ${}</h2>
    <p>
      These templates make it easier to do operations through expressions, but
      they need back-ticks ```````````` when opening and closing the strings.
      (AltGr + }) and a dollar sign followed by opening and closing curly
      braces, where our math will be.
    </p>
    <p>`Hello, you paid ${55 + 65} dollars.`</p>
    <p>RESULTS IN --> 'Hello, you paid 120 dollars.'</p>
    <p>
      This way, it will be evaluated in JS, if we use single or double quotes it
      will look like this:
    </p>
    <p>"Hello, you paid ${55 + 65} dollars."</p>
    <p>RESULTS IN --> 'Hello, you paid ${55 + 65} dollars.'</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>First template but with LITERALS.</h2>
    <p>Originally:</p>
    <p>
      let summary = "You bought " + eggsBought + " eggs for a total of $" +
      eggPrice * eggsBought + " dollars!"
    </p>
    <p>Now:</p>
    <p>
      let summary = `You bought ${eggsBought} eggs for a total of $${eggPrice *
      eggsBought} dollars!`
    </p>
    <p>BOTH RESULT IN --> 'You bought 36 eggs for a total of $7.2 dollars!'</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      We used a lot less quotes, and no plus signs to string it all together!
    </p>
    <p>
      And if we wanted, we could use string methods inside the curly braces too.
