    <h1>Inline and External Events</h1>
    <h2>Inline Events</h2>
    <p>
      We can have code run at specific events, like when the user clicks on a
      button:
    </p>
    <img src="onClick.png" alt="" />
    <p>(IN HTML)</p>
    <p>We need to pay attention to the quotes we use with inline events.</p>
    <button onclick="alert('Hi')">Click Me!</button>
    <p>
      One downside with this method od events is that we need to type the same
      code every time we want that event to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, to have multiple events for the same action, we need to separate the
      events with a semicolon.
    </p>
    <img src="dblclick.png" alt="" />
    <button
      ondblclick="alert('Why did you double-click me?');alert('DonÂ´t do it again!')"
    >
      Double-click Me!
    </button>
    <h2>External Events</h2>
    <p>
      We can also link our JS document to our HTML and create our events there.
      We normally use functions, which can be saved and used, or just created as
      function expressions. We must declare a variable to associate the event to
      our button.
    </p>
    <img src="externalEventsonclickHTML.png" alt="" />
    <p>Here we use a function expression:</p>
    <img src="externalEventsonclickJS.png" alt="" />
    <p></p>
    <button id="btn1">Another button</button>
    <hr />
    <p>Here we declare a function, and save it to an event for our button:</p>
    <img src="onmouseenter.png" alt="" />
    <p>(It has a class of btn2 on our HTML)</p>
    <button class="btn2">Please don't hover me!</button>
    <script src="inlineAndExternalEvents.js"></script>
  </body>
