    <title>Handling Errors in Express</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Handling Errors in Express</h1>
    <p>
      There are many errors we might find, like with our syntax, other services
      and tools, our databases, API errors, etc.
    </p>
    <p>We must try to anticipate as many of these situations as possible.</p>
    <h2>Built-In Error Handler</h2>
    <p>
      Express has a default behavior for error handling, which is a copy of our
      HTML, with a request code of 500.
    </p>
    <p>We can throw our own errors like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>throw new Error("")</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Defining Custom Error Handlers</h2>
    <p>We can create our own error handlers too.</p>
    <p>
      In order for this to work, there are four arguments we must pass in our
      error handling middleware function.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>app.use(err,req,res,next)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We should position these code blocks after the other app.use() we may
      have.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can console log a desired message, the error itself, and even generate
      a special webpage as a response:
    </p>
    <img src="customErrorHandlingNoNext.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      If we include next(err), we will have to remove the res.send(), since the
      request will continue to the next error handling middleware, which if not
      specified would be the default handler from Express.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        (REGULAR next() IS TO GO TO THE NEXT MIDDLEWARE, AND next(err) IS USED
        TO GO TO THE NEXT ERROR HANDLING MIDDLEWARE.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="customErrorHandlingWithNext.png" alt="" />
    <h2>Custom Error Class</h2>
    <p>
      We can create a separate js file with an error which we can call on in our
      app by saving it to a class.
    </p>

    <img src="appErrorClassFile.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      We can then include it in our paths by throwing it in instead of a regular
      Error followed by the status code we want to be returned.
    </p>
    <img src="appErrorExecutionCodePath.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      Or we can destructure our error object, (the same one we created on a
      different file), and set its status to another code we want, in case there
      is no default in that other file:
    </p>
    <img src="appErrorClassDestructured.png" alt="" />
    <p>And we could further destructure our app error object:</p>
    <p>
      If we include more arguments on our error object, we could also use those
      after destructuring them too.
    </p>

    <h2>Handling Async Errors</h2>
    <p>
      When we have to wait for an asynchronous function to return a value, or
      check for an existing piece of data, etc., the way we handle errors is
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like when we pass next(err), we must place our thrown new Error with
      the status code and message.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We do not include the keyword throw when working with async functions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="errorHandlingAsyncFunction.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      We can use return on our next() to make sure the content outside our
      conditional is never sent. Also an else would work.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When working with a real error, and not one we produced or threw
      ourselves, we will have to use try{} and catch{}.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can wrap all of our code in the try{}, and we can use catch(err){} and
      pass in next(err) inside, remembering to add next as an argument of our
      async function.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will catch the error and a default response will be shown to the
      user. (Which we can customize later.)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We need to do this with every path if it is an async function, otherwise
        Express can handle it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We can use the throw new Error/classError to our advantage in a
      conditional expression. We can intentionally throw an error if a statement
      is false, with the complete conditional inside our try{}, which would send
      it to our catch(err){next(err)} which would handle it!
    </p>
    <img src="asyncErrorHandling.png" alt="" />
    <h2>Async Utility</h2>
    <p>
      Instead of using try and catch on every single path we use, we can create
      an async utility function.
    </p>
    <p>This will help us reduce duplicate code.</p>
    <p>
      We are creating a function which accepts another function as a parameter,
      and inside it we first return the function along with our regular req,res
      and next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we execute the parameter function with those same arguments and add a
      catch function, where we take any error and use next along with the error
      to find an error handling middleware.
    </p>
    <p>We can later move the function to a separate file if needed.</p>
    <img src="wrapAsyncFunctionReduceDuplication.png" alt="" />
    <h2>Telling apart Mongoose specific Errors</h2>
    <p>Sometimes we may want custom feedback from a Mongoose error.</p>
    <p>
      Like when we try to access an id which doesn't exist, if it has the same
      number of characters as our working id's, it will not be catched by
      express.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will instead get a Mongoose error on the screen regarding the
      inexistent object upon looking for it in our database.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can create a logger to log the error type in our console and use next
      to pass the error to our error handling middleware.
    </p>
    <p>This will tell us if it was a CastError, ValidationError, etc.</p>
    <p>
      We can then include specific functions that handle each type of error in a
      different way inside the same error handling middleware.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can create function for each type of error that we can have our error
      handling middleware execute on the error itself if the error matches the
      options we feed it. Or even use our class error function along with an
      error code we specify.
