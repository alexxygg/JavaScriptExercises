    <h1>Nested arrays</h1>
    <p>
      We can have multile arrays in one array. They are some times called
      multi-dimensional arrays, or nested arrays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we made a 4 by 4 array set, so there are 4 arrays with 4 items on
      each.
    </p>
    <p>We need commas between each array inside our main array.</p>

    <p>This is how it looks in the console:</p>
    <img src="nestedArray4x4Console.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      We can access an array by using the square brackets. If we only use one
      index, we would access the array at that index.
    </p>
    <p>
      To access an item from one of the arrays, we have to add a second set of
      squared braces with the index of that specific item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we first access the third array with index 2, then the third item
      with index 2 also.

    <h2>Replacing an item value in a nested array.</h2>
    <p>
      If we were looking to change the x we accessed in the previous picture, we
      can do that like this:

      Or here where we have an empty seat at an airplane, represented by null:
