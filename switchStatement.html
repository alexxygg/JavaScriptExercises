    <h1>switch Statement</h1>
    <p>It can replace multiple if statements.</p>
    <p>
      It is very important to have break; included after every case, otherwise,
      the code will do what the first matching case says, but also all the
      subsequent code, like a car without BREAKS!
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, instead of an else statement, we use default: , which also goes
      inside the curly brackets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It works just like an else, so if the entry does not match any of our
      cases, that is the action that will be performed.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example made with if/else if/else:</p>

    <p>Here is the same but made with a switch statement.</p>
    <p>
      We have a case for each number of day, and a default option in case none
      of the cases are matched.

      <p>We can also have multiple cases do the same thing.</p>
      <p>Here, if we enter a day number between 1 and 5, it will be considered a weekday.(Weekdays in this case being from Monday to Friday)</p>
      <p>And a weekend day for 6 and 7.(Saturday and Sunday)</p>
      <p>Same default as before.</p>
