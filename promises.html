    <h1>Promises in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of
      an asynchronous operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we eat our vegetables, we may be promised to have ice cream. Like a
      guarantee of something happening depending on other factors.
    </p>
    <p>The object can be pending, resolved or rejected. The status changes.</p>
    <p>
      We wait for the retuned value to run code 1 or code 2, depending on the
      result.
    </p>
