    <h1>Try and Catch</h1>
    <p>These are two statements that help us catch errors.</p>
    <p>
      If we anticipate an error, we can crash the code to make sure it doesn't
      expand.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can wrap our possibly bad code inside a catch with curly brackets
      surrounding the code itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also need to use a catch statement, also with two curly brackets, where
      we will enter an alternate code, this code will only run if our try block
      actually returns an error.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example.</p>
