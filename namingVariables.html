    <title>Naming Variables</title>

    <h1>Naming Variables</h1>
    <p>The name is an identifier, and it should be descriptive.</p>
    <p>They can have numbers:</p>
    <p>let user254 = 5;</p>
    <p>But it can not be the first character, it will give us an error.</p>
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <h3>undercase</h3>
    <p>We should not start with an undercase: let _hey = true;</p>
    <h3>CamelCase</h3>
    <p>
      It is possible to name a variable nameofvariable, but we should uppercase
      each first letter of words after the first one.
    </p>
    <p>oneTwoThreeFour</p>
    <p>theNameOfMyVariable</p>
    <hr />
    <p>under_case and under-case is bad practice, we should use underCase.</p>
    <h3>Clearness</h3>
    <p>
      gameOver is a bad name, it would be more clear if we call it isGameOver.
    </p>
    <p>
      They should be meaningful, it doesnÂ´t matter if it is a little longer.
