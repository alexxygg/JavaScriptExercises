    <h1>GET vs POST Requests</h1>
    <h3>GET</h3>
    <p>This is the default request type, it helps us:</p>
    <p>Retrieve information</p>
    <p>Data sent via query string</p>
    <p>Information is visible in the URL.</p>
    <p>Limited amount of data can be sent.</p>
    <h3>POST</h3>
    <p>Used to post data to the server.</p>
    <p>We can write/create/update</p>
    <p>
      We can include a body, like a JS or JSON object, plain text, HTML. We do
      this instead of using a query string.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can send any sort of data. We can directly interact with a server,
      unlike GET which doesn't update/make changes, delete or create new
      content.
    </p>
    <p>There's more flexibility overall.</p>
    <h2>Defining Express post routes.</h2>
    <p>
      WHen we specify a path for the URL the user enters, it is important to
      understand that even if the path is the same, they will get different
      results if they use a get request instead of a post request.
    </p>
    <p>
      This would depend on what response we provide for each app.get() or
      app.post() response.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
    <p>
      These 2 forms would provide a different result, depending on which form is
      submitted.

    <h2>Retrieving and using POST data.</h2>
    <p>
      We can now extract the data from the post request! The returned data is
      parsed automatically, we just need to specify the parsing type.
    </p>
    <p>request.body will provide us the information entered.</p>
    <p>
      It is undefined by default, but we can explicitly state how it should be
      parsed.
    </p>
    <p>We do this with app.use():</p>

    <p>
      This will save the data into key value pairs in an object, which we can
      console log or save to our databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      WE MUST GIVE OUR INPUTS A NAME, SINCE IT WILL BE THE KEY NAME OF OUR
      OBJECT, OTHERWISE WE WILL BE RETURNED AN EMPTY OBJECT.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Instead of just console logging the object for ourselves, we can
      destructure it to provide a more personal response:
    </p>
    <p>
      (We gave the text input a name of tacoType and the number input a name of
      quantity)
    </p>

    <p>
      All this works with form data, which is common, but if we wanted to use an
      API tool and enter the values RAW (JSON), from an object, we would need to
      specify a parsing type for JSON too:
