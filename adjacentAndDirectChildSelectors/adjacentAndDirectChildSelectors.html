    <h1>Adjacent and Direct child selectors</h1>
    <p>
      These two help us be specific about the elements we are trying to style.
    </p>
    <h2>Adjacent selector</h2>
    <p>
      The adjacent selector uses a plus sign, which indicates we want the
      element that goes right after the first one.
    </p>
    <p>Below we have 3 buttons.</p>
    <p>
      We only want to style the buttons that have a paragraph right before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We used this code to achieve this: p + button { background-color: tomato;
      }
    </p>
    <div>
      <button>HELLOOOO</button>
      <button>HELLOOOO</button>
      <button>HELLOOOO</button>
    </div>
    <h2>Direct child selector</h2>
    <p>
      The direct child selector is used when trying to access an element focused
      more on the structure of your code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below we have many buttons, they are all inside a form, but we also have
      one outside the form.
    </p>
    <p>We can access it with the selector we just mentioned.</p>
    <p>
      The code we used to reach it is: body > button { background-color: aqua; }
    </p>
    <form action="fdfdfdfd">
      <button>Button</button>
      <button>Button</button>
      <button>Button</button>
      <button>Button</button>
      <button>Button</button>
      <button>Button</button>
    </form>
    <button>Button outside form</button>
  </body>
</html>
