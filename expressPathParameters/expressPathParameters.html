  <title>Express Path Parameters</title>

  <h1>Express Path Parameters</h1>
  <p>
    We already know about direct match routing, but sometimes we are looking
    for patterns for our routes.
  </p>
  <p>We can define a generic pattern to prevent making hundreds of routes.</p>
  <p>
    The parameters we include will not be hardcoded, they will not need to be
    matched in exact word form, but are instead a pattern or path.
  </p>
  <p>We just check for the pattern, the parameters are variables.</p>

  <p>
    We can destructure the request object to extract the user's search and use
    it as we like, for this we use request.params. We can save it in a
    variable, even if we have multiple parameters.
  </p>

  <p>Multiple parameters:</p>

  <p>This creates specific webpages depending on the user's request.</p>
  <h2>Query Strings</h2>
  <p>
    The request object has a property called query, made with the query string
    pairs. (key and value)
  </p>
  <p>
    We can enter these pairs manually in the URL, or with the parameter option
    on an API tool.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon returning the request object, we will now see the pairs in the
    object. (EMPTY OBJECT IF NO QUERIES)
  </p>
  <p>
    If we were to console log the request.query we would see it/them as key
    value pairs.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can also extract this object pair and use it on the user's webpage:

  <h2>Restarting our server</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of restarting our server each time we make a change, we can do
    this automatically with Nodemon.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a package we can install globally to use in the command line. It
    will watch for changes and restart our server when changes are detected.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can also be installed locally on each project, however, we will not
    have access to the nodemon command.
  </p>
  <p>nodemon -v gives us the version.</p>
  <p>
    Instead of running our index or other files with: node index.js, we will
    run nodemon index.js.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will automatically receive a command line message saying that the
    server was restarted upon saving any changes in our server file!
  </p>
  <p>NO NEED FOR Ctrl c + node index.js ANYMORE!!!</p>
