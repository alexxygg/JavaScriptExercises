    <title>Express Middleware</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Express Middleware</h1>
    <p>They are functions that run during the request and response.</p>
    <p>They have access to the req and res objects.</p>
    <p>
      It can end the HTTP request by sending back a response, i.e res.send()
    </p>
    <p>OR it can be chained together, one after another by using next()</p>
    <p>It can execute code, make changes to req and res too.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Morgan</h2>
    <p>It helps us log HTTP requests into our terminal.</p>
    <p>We can install it with npm i morgan.</p>
    <p>
      It will log the type of request, the path and the ms it takes to send the
      response!
    </p>
    <p>
      We just have to save it to a variable. (require it) and execute it with
      app.use().
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>const morgan = require("morgan");</li>
      <li>app.use(morgan("tiny"));</li>
      <p>
        It can be customized further. Using dev instead of tiny will colorize
        the HTTP code. common will include the date, etc.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>Our own middleware.</h2>
    <p>We can write our own middleware to use on our apps.</p>
    <p>
      By including a third argument in our functions, which we can call next, we
      are telling our code to move on to the NEXT middleware, the only other
      thing we need to do is execute next by including next() inside our
      function.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we don't call next, the line ends where the last middleware that DOES
      call next is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any code we include after calling next will still run, eventually after
      finishing the order of next calls. It may be important to pay attention to
      order.
    </p>
    <p>(res.send() will stop any chain)</p>

    <hr />
    <p>
      This will console log the request type and the path the user requested.
      Close to what Morgan does. It will also apply POST to any request, even if
      it is a browser GET request since we are applying it to all incoming
      requests.
    </p>
    <img src="reqMethodReqPath.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      It is important to position our middleware correctly, as they may not run
      if another response is matched and sent before it reaches our code.
    </p>
    <p>Any res.send() will stop any code below it from executing!!!</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>app.use()</h2>
    <p>
      We know any code inside an app.use() will run on every single incoming
      request.
    </p>
    <p>We can use this to our advantage:</p>
    <img src="appDotUseForAllRequestTypes.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      This console log will run if we make a GET/POST/PUT/PATCH etc. request,
      but only if the request is for /dogs!.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we had many routes that start the same way, we may want a particular
      middleware for all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can even run the middleware IF it includes dogs anywhere on the request
      if needed.
    </p>
    <h2>404 NOT FOUND Error</h2>
    <p>
      We can include an app.use() at the end of our code, it will only run if
      none of our paths are matched.
    </p>
    <p>There's no need for next here, since it is at the end.</p>
    <p>
      It will return a 200 code, since technically a path was matched, which is
      our middleware.
    </p>
    <img src="404errorHandlingAppDotUse.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      We can simply add res.status(404) before our .send() to change the default
      200 code:
    </p>
    <img src="resDotStatus404.png" alt="" />
    <h2>Protecting all/specific routes</h2>
    <p>
      If we wanted to add a level of security to all of our paths, we could ass
      some code:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It will check if there is a query string with a key of password and a
        value of thePassword. If it does, it will continue to the nect
        middleware, whichever match it finds. If not, we will send a wrong
        password message.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is important to place it before all of our paths in order to check
        for the condition before providing the user a match.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="simpleSecurityLevelAllPaths.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      If we wanted to only apply to a specific path, we could include it in a
      string before the function arguments:
    </p>
    <img src="simpleSecurityLevelSinglePath.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      OR we could save the code to a function, and include it in between the
      path and the function arguments!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This will allow us to reuse our function only in the paths we want,
        while only defining the function once!
      </li>
      <p>
        We must make sure to include the next argument and function execution in
        order to have our response sent.
      </p>
    </ul>
