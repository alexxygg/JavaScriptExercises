    <h1>Event delegation</h1>
    <p>
      Event delegation helps us perform actions or run code on elements that do
      not yet exist upon loading our webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good example is with comments from users, since they will not yet exist
      on the webpage when the user is seeing a post. He/she may decide to
      comment a minute after the post has been on the user's display.
    </p>
    <p>We delegate by performing our code on the parent element.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Here is an example:</p>
    <p>We have a form we use to post comments on a webpage.</p>
    <p>
      We can add an event listener for clicks on any elements that are exactly
      an li inside our ul, wheter it already exists or not.(Any other element
      would not be removed or deleted.)
    </p>
    <h3>.target</h3>
    <p>
      We can do this with .target, which selects whatever the user interacted
      with. It is run after the event object!
    </p>
    <h3>nodeType</h3>
    <p>
      nodeType checks the element type, it will return the type of what the user
      clicked, which we need here to make sure we don't delete something other
      than a comment.

    <p>Click on your posted comment to delete it.</p>
