    <h1>Databases</h1>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      They can handle large amounts od data efficiently and store it compactly.
    </p>
    <p>They provide tools for easy insertion, querying and updating data.</p>
    <p>They offer security features and control over access to data.</p>
    <p>They scale well.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Types</h2>
    <h3>SQL vs noSQL</h3>
    <h3>SQL</h3>
    <p>Examples: MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, Oracle,, Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
    <p>
      They share a basic syntax and there are preset patterns, even before we
      include our data. They are relational databases and certain data sections
      reference each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we may have a section for our posts data, a post may
      reference various comments, and all comments, regardless of their post,
      may be in another sections called comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The predefined structure determines how the data will be stored, and the
      relation between sections.
    </p>
    <h3>noSQL</h3>
    <p>Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, Redis</p>
    <p>They are newer and more diverse.</p>
    <p>
      A document-oriented database puts information in a file, in XML, JSON,
      etc. They don't separate data, just store it all in the same place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like saving everything related to a single post inside a single object.
      Anything we want to add would be a new key and value.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>MongoDB</h3>
    <p>MongoDB is the most popular database, it works as a noSQL database.</p>
    <p>It is commonly used with Node and Express.(MEAN and MERN stacks)</p>
    <p>It is easy to get started when knowing JavaScript</p>
    <p>Due to its popularity, it has a strong community of developers.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The Mongo Shell is very useful, not just like the node js REPL which we
      use to test things and use as a sandbox.
    </p>
    <p>We open it by typing mongosh in the terminal.</p>
    <p>
      Once we are running MongoDB, we can access this shell and run any
      JavaScript commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can have multiple databases running at the same time, one for each of
      our apps if needed.
    </p>
    <p>They are not connected and work separately.</p>
    <p>
      BY default db is our database. We can see all databases by entering show
      databases/show dbs in the shell.
    </p>
    <p>Some are pre-made, but we can create our own.</p>
    <p>
      To do so, we type use followed by the name we want for our new database.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will check if there is an existing database with the same name, and if
      not, it will switch us to that database.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not see it with show dbs until there is any data in it, otherwise
      it will forget it since it is empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any time we enter use database after the first time for the same database,
      it will simply switch to it.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>BSON</h2>
    <p>
      We know about JSON, which allows us to represent objects in nested
      structures.
    </p>
    <p>BSON is a text-based format</p>
    <p>
      Its a more compact version of JSON, MongoDB will store our JSON to a
      representation of binary, which takes less space in memory.
    </p>
    <p>There are extra types in BSON too!</p>
    <h1>CRUD</h1>
    <h2>Inserting into MongoDB databases (C)</h2>
    <p>
      To do this, we need a group of data, called a collection, where we will
      insert the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be a collection for every major or important section of our
      data. We can show them with the terminal command --> show collections.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we insert something into a collection that doesn't exist, it will be
      inserted while also creating the collection.
    </p>
    <p>We can insert with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>db.collection.insertOne() --> One object.</li>
      <li>db.collection.insertMany() --> An array of objects.</li>
      <li>db.collection.insert() --> EITHER ONE OR MULTIPLE OBJECTS.</li>
      <li>
        (Where "collection" is replaced with our desired collection name.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Inside the parenthesis we can pass in a JavaScript object with key value
      pairs, which will be converted to BSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      (There is no need for any type of consistency with they keys of one object
      compared to another. If needed we can enforce a default to opposite this
      default.)
    </p>
    <p>
      With .insertOne(), we will get a message of acknowledgement of true along
      with the object's id (Primary key _id, unique for every entry, made
      automatically by MongoDB.).
    </p>
    <p>
      We can confirm by entering show collections, where we will see our newly
      created collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can see a preview of our object along with all its properties with -->
      db.collectionName.find()
    </p>
    <p>
      With .insert(), we will get a BulkWriteResult object, where nInserted will
      have a value matching the number of objects inserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      (WE MUST MAKE SURE WE ARE IN THE CORRECT DATABASE TO ACCESS A COLLECTION,
      IT WORKS THROUGH PATHS AS WITH REGULAR FILES.)
    </p>
    <h2>Finding with MongoDB databases (R)</h2>
    <p>
      We can include a key value pair inside db.collectionName.find(), it is
      case-sensitive and the pair or pairs (ACCEPTS MULTIPLE) must go inside an
      object's curly brackets.
    </p>
    <p>It will return 0, 1 or more results.</p>
    <p>
      If we use db.collectionName.findOne(), we will be returned the actual
      document, not the cursor/reference like with regular find().
    </p>
    <p>There are more complex things like finding EITHER x or y, etc.</p>
    <h2>Updating with MongoDB databases (U)</h2>
    <p>To make updates to our existing objects, we must use update().</p>
    <p>
      We can use updateOne(), updateMany() and update(), just like with
      insert().
    </p>
    <p>It will take two arguments, both inside curly brackets.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first is to search for the object we want to update, where we can
        pass one of its properties/key value pairs.
      </li>
      <li>
        The seconds must include $set: followed by an object with the update we
        are trying to make.
      </li>
      <p>Example: db.collectionName.update({},{$set:{}})</p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We can include as many updates for the selected object as long as they're
      inside the $set:{} brackets, separated by commas.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we include an update for a key that doesn't exist, it will be created
      and added to the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      With db.collectionName.updateMany(), we will update all matches for our
      first find argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are more operators like $set: we can use and combine in the same
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>$currentDate: will add the current date and time to the key we add.</p>
    <p>
      Example: db.collectionName.update({},{$set:{},$currentDate{timeChanged:
      true}})
    </p>
    <p>With replace() we will change everything to a new value.</p>
    <h2>Deleting with MongoDB databases (D)</h2>
    <p>We can use deleteOne() and deleteMany().</p>
    <p>
      It takes in one argument to find the object/objects we want to delete.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can pass in multiple keys and values for a more specific search, only
      separated by commas.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can delete an entire collection with deleteMany({}), the object must be
      empty for it to work.
    </p>
    <h2>Additional MongoDB Operators</h2>
    <p>
      We can look for matches between 2 values, or use exceptions to get
      everything but a key value pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we are looking for a key value pair that is inside an object nested in
      the original object, we must use a period/dot to separate the objects as
      in a path.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we have an object, and inside there is a key called date with an object
      as a property, which has day, month and year as key value pairs, and we
      were looking for all matches of day:11, we would access day like this:
    </p>
    <p>db.collectionName.find({"date.day":11})</p>
    <p>We can include multiple factors for our search separated by commas:</p>
    <p>db.collectionName.find({"date.day":11,vaccinated:true})</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      There are operators to check for greater than, less than, equal to, not
      equal to, and, or, not, etc.
    </p>
    <h3>$gt (greater than)</h3>
    <p>To look for all matches with an age greater than 8:</p>
    <p>db.collectionName.find({age:{$gt:8}})</p>
    <p>$gte is used the same way (Greater than or equal to).</p>
    <p>$lt (less than)</p>
    <h3>$in</h3>
    <p>
      This tells the search to find any of our inputs from an array of values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: db.collectionName.find({color:{$in:["red","white","brown"]}})
    </p>
    <p>
      Any object with a key of color and a value that matches one of those in
      the array we pass in will be returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can combine as many operators as we want to only get the results we
      want.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we were to use $nin: (not in), we would get all matches that do NOT
      have the values of our array.
    </p>
    <h3>Logical Operators and, or, not</h3>
    <p>We can use these operators to add logic to our search.</p>
    <p>
      Here is an example with $or, if either one of these factors is met, the
      object will be returned.
    </p>
    <p>If color is red OR age is less than 8:</p>
    <p>db.collectionName.find({$or:[{color:"red"},{age:{$lt:8}}]})</p>
