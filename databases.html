    <h1>Databases</h1>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      They can handle large amounts od data efficiently and store it compactly.
    </p>
    <p>They provide tools for easy insertion, querying and updating data.</p>
    <p>They offer security features and control over access to data.</p>
    <p>They scale well.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Types</h2>
    <h3>SQL vs noSQL</h3>
    <h3>SQL</h3>
    <p>Examples: MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, Oracle,, Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
    <p>
      They share a basic syntax and there are preset patterns, even before we
      include our data. They are relational databases and certain data sections
      reference each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we may have a section for our posts data, a post may
      reference various comments, and all comments, regardless of their post,
      may be in another sections called comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The predefined structure determines how the data will be stored, and the
      relation between sections.
    </p>
    <h3>noSQL</h3>
    <p>Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, Redis</p>
    <p>They are newer and more diverse.</p>
    <p>
      A document-oriented database puts information in a file, in XML, JSON,
      etc. They don't separate data, just store it all in the same place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like saving everything related to a single post inside a single object.
      Anything we want to add would be a new key and value.
    </p>

    <h3>MongoDB</h3>
    <p>MongoDB is the most popular database, it works as a noSQL database.</p>
    <p>It is commonly used with Node and Express.(MEAN and MERN stacks)</p>
    <p>It is easy to get started when knowing JavaScript</p>
    <p>Due to its popularity, it has a strong community of developers.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The Mongo Shell is very useful, not just like the node js REPL which we
      use to test things and use as a sandbox.
    </p>
    <p>We open it by typing mongosh in the terminal.</p>
    <p>
      Once we are running MongoDB, we can access this shell and run any
      JavaScript commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can have multiple databases running at the same time, one for each of
      our apps if needed.
    </p>
    <p>They are not connected and work separately.</p>
    <p>
      BY default db is our database. We can see all databases by entering show
      databases/show dbs in the shell.
    </p>
    <p>Some are pre-made, but we can create our own.</p>
    <p>
      To do so, we type use followed by the name we want for our new database.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will check if there is an existing database with the same name, and if
      not, it will switch us to that database.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not see it with show dbs until there is any data in it, otherwise
      it will forget it since it is empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any time we enter use database after the first time for the same database,
      it will simply switch to it.
    </p>
