    <h1>Express JS</h1>
    <p>
      It helps with the requests made from the user. It checks and saves things
      into our database, and then executes our response.
    </p>
    <p>It:</p>
    <p>It starts up a server to listen for requests.</p>
    <p>Parse incoming requests.</p>
    <p>Match those requests to a certain route.</p>
    <p>
      It is an NPM package that comes with methods and optional plugins we can
      use to build web applications and API's.
    </p>
    <h3>Libraries and frameworks</h3>
    <p>
      The difference is that a library can be integrated to our code, and we
      decide when to use it. A framework typically switch the control, it
      provides the structure, and we only participate with our code.
    </p>
    <p>There's less freedom and flexibility with frameworks.</p>
    <p>Express is a framework, lightweight and right in the middle.</p>
    <p>
      Some of them require us to give up a lot of control, as far as how we name
      our files, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting our server</h2>
    <p>We must import express first.</p>
    <p>
      Then save it to a variable, and make another variable for the executed
      function itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally we can use listen() to start the server, this is where we include
      our port number.
    </p>

    <h2>The request and response Objects</h2>
    <p>
      When a user makes a request to our server, we will automatically get an
      object with all the request information.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>
      If user requests 3000/dogs, the object will have a key for our path and a
      value of /dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we use an API that requires a header, it will show on a key called
      headers and show the value.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>We can call this argument object res or request for clarity.</p>
    <p>
      Now we can use a method called req.send() to return something to the user
      each time we receive a request.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use an API tool to see the response when entering our server's
      address and using GET.
    </p>
    <p>Using an API tool will also log a request to our server.</p>
    <p>We can return strings, HTML tagged content, objects, etc in quotes.</p>

    <hr />
    <h2>Routing</h2>
    <p>This is how we use different responses to different requests.</p>
    <p>We match a code as a response based on the specific request.</p>
    <h3>app.get()</h3>
    <p>
      This method takes 2 arguments, a path request and a function where we use
      our request and response objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can assign each of our websites to one of these methods, to match the
      request with the relevant path.
    </p>
    <p>
      (WE WON'T GET ANYTHING THROUGH AN API TOOL IF WE TRY WITH POST INSTEAD OF
      GET, UNLESS WE ASSIGN A RESPONSE TO app.post(). THIS WILL BE DIFFERENT
      THAN GET, EACH TYPE OF REQUEST WILL WORK INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE OTHERS. IF
      NOTHING IS ASSIGNED TO A PARTICULAR TYPE OF REQUEST, THE USER WILL SIMPLY
      GET AN ERROR.)
    </p>
    <p>There are many types of requests like post, put, delete, etc.</p>
    <p>
      We can set a default response if nothing matches the user's request with
      the star symbol:
    </p>
    <p>
      app.get( "*", (request, response) => `WE COULDN'T FIND WHAT YOU WERE
      LOOKING FOR :(` );
    </p>
    <p>
      *WE MUST MAKE SURE TO PUT THIS CODE AFTER ALL OTHER REQUESTS, SINCE WE CAN
      ONLY RETURN 1 RESPONSE AT A TIME, AND SINCE THIS CATCHES ALL REQUESTS, IT
      WOULD RETURN EVERY TIME!
