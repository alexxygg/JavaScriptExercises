    <h1>Methods with Arguments</h1>
    <p>
      Some string methods allow us to enter arguments to be more specific of
      what we are trying to do.
    </p>
    <h2>.indexOf()</h2>
    <p>This string method tells us where our argument is indexed.</p>
    <p>let catchPhrase = "Hasta la vista, baby."</p>
    <p>catchPhrase.indexOf("s")</p>
    <p>
      This will give us the index of the first occurrence of a letter 's' only.
    </p>
    <p>Results in: 2</p>
    <h2>Portions of a string</h2>
    <p>catchPhrase.indexOf("vista")</p>
    <p>Results in: 9</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      If we look for something that does not exist, it will give us a result of
      -1.
    </p>
    <p>catchPhrase.indexOf("!")</p>
    <p>Results in: -1</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>.slice()</h2>
    <p>
      It returns a portion of a string, we can pass in a beginning index and an
      ending index, which is optional.
    </p>
    <p>
      The value we give it first is the starting point for the returning sliced
      string.
    </p>
    <h3>starting point only</h3>
    <p>catchPhrase.slice(16);</p>
    <p>
      Here the character at index 16 is letter b, so it will include it in the
      new string and end where the string normally ends, since we did not
      declare a limit to the slice.
    </p>
    <p>RESULTS IN --> 'baby.'</p>
    <h3>starting and ending points</h3>
    <p>
      When also using an ending point for our sliced string, we must know that
      the two indexes must be separated by a comma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also that the ending index is not included, so a .slice(5 , 9) would
      include index 5, 6, 7 and 8.
    </p>
    <p>
      Index 6 has the letter 'l' from 'la'. Index 14 is the comma after 'vista',
      this comma will not be included.
    </p>
    <p>catchPhrase.indexOf(6 , 14)</p>
    <p>RESULTS IN --> 'la vista'</p>
    <h3>Negatives</h3>
    <p>
      We can enter a negative number, but it will return characters starting
      from the end of the string.
    </p>
    <p>catchPhrase.slice(-1);</p>
    <p>'.'</p>
    <p>catchPhrase.slice(-3);</p>
    <p>'by.'</p>
    <p>catchPhrase.slice(-5);</p>
    <p>'baby.'</p>
    <h2>.replace()</h2>
    <p>It helps us replace certain characters or words from our string.</p>
    <p>
      We need to enter two parameters, what we are trying to replace (what the
      method will look for in our existing string), and what we want to replace
      that with (the new character or word, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>catchPhrase.replace("vista", "replacement");</p>
    <p>RESULTS IN --> 'Hasta la replacement, baby.'</p>
    <p>It will only replace the first matching instance.</p>
    <h2>.repeat()</h2>
    <p>"I will not bite my nails. ".repeat(5)</p>
    <p>
      'I will not bite my nails. I will not bite my nails. I will not bite my
      nails. I will not bite my nails. I will not bite my nails. '
    </p>
