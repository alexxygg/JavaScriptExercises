    <h1>Strings</h1>
    <p>
      This is another primitive value type. We store text, symbols and numbers
      in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use single quotes or double quotes, but we can not start a string
      with one and finish with the other, we would get an error.
    </p>
    <p>let username = "danny";</p>
    <p>let username = "George";</p>
    <p>let name = 'Alex';</p>
    <p>They can have spaces once inside the quotes.</p>
    <p>"My name is Alex."</p>

    <p>
      If we are to include one or the other inside our string, we should do it
      logically.
    </p>
    <p>"The TV screen is 55' diagonally."</p>
    <p>'and I quote, "I will never do that again".'</p>
    <p>let bestColor = "purple";</p>
    <p>let quote = 'You had me at "hello"';</p>
    <p>We should use the same type of string in a single document.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Creating a string with a number inside it does not mean it is a number.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can make a string with a single character or none at all, called an
      empty string "".
    </p>

    <h2>Strings are indexed</h2>
    <p>
      Each character has a corresponding index, which is in relation to its
      position.
    </p>
    <p>let animal = "Giant Octopus";</p>
    <p>animal[0] = "G"</p>
    <p>animal[1] = "i"</p>
    <p>animal[2] = "a"</p>
    <p>animal[3] = "n"</p>
    <p>animal[4] = "t"</p>
    <p>animal[5] = ""</p>
    <p>animal[6] = "O"</p>
    <p>animal[7] = "c"</p>
    <p>animal[8] = "t"</p>
    <p>animal[9] = "o"</p>
    <p>animal[10] = "p"</p>
    <p>animal[11] = "u"</p>
    <p>animal[12] = "s"</p>
    <p>"Giant Octopus".lenght;</p>
    <p>Result: 13</p>
    <hr />
    <p>"animal".lenght;</p>
    <p>
      Result is 6, although the last letter, "l", is one less than that, index
      5.
    </p>
    <h2>Spacing strings / Concatination</h2>
    <p>
      We can not change a string simply by updating its value, we would be
      creating a totally new string instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we try to concatinate these two strings, but since neither have a
      space at the end or start respectively, they are just next to each other
      in the result.
    </p>
    <p>let firstName = "Alejandro";</p>
    <p>let lastName = "Perez";</p>
    <p>firstName + lastName;</p>
    <p>"AlejandroPerez"</p>
    <p>
      Here we create a string that only has a space in it, and add it in between
      our two original strings.
    </p>
    <p>firstName + " " + lastName;</p>
    <p>"Alejandro Perez"</p>
    <p>We can store this new string in a new variable like this:</p>
    <p>let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;</p>
  </body>
