    <h1>Query Strings</h1>
    <p>
      We may see endpoints with classes on API documentation that are used to
      specify the id that we are requesting, which is to be replaced by us.
    </p>
    <p>Query Strings show on our address bars and have the following syntax:</p>
    <p>?sort=desc&color=blue</p>
    <p>They are key value pairs separated by ampersand characters.</p>
    <p>
      This address tells us that the value of sort is desc AND also that the
      value of color is blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can append anything to our strings when making a request, anything that
      we add to it that the API database doesn't recognize will simply be
      ignored.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>
      https://swapi.dev/api/starships/10/?color=blue&details=true&random=yes
    </p>
    <p>Only https://swapi.dev/api/starships/10/ will be used.</p>
    <p>It won't look for the rest, it doesn't care.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Some APIs will only accept requests made with their specific query
      selectors, and will otherwise not work.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can instead enter query parameters if we don't want to enter the url
      manually with all the specifications. We can also toggle the parameters
      this way.
    </p>
    <h2>HTTP Headers</h2>
    <p>They allow us to pass key value pairs, small add-ons for our request.</p>

    <p>
      It is information returned by the server regarding the request, some APIs
      require headers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The documentation lets us know of the specifications we must fill for the
      key value pairs, if it is needed.
