    <h1>forEach Method</h1>
    <p>This method accepts a callback function.</p>
    <p>It calls the function once for every element/item in the array.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Here we have an array with 20 items, also a function which will take a
      number and return a console log of that number plus 20.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can always run the function separately for each array item, but it
      would take longer.
    </p>
    <p>Using the forEach() method makes it much easier.</p>

    <h2>forEach() and for of loop</h2>
    <p>Here are a few more examples.</p>
    <p>
      The first code runs a function for each of the items and console logs the
      product of a number times two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second code console logs only even numbers, it checks every item too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third code shows us that we can also use a for loop to access every
      item in the array.

    <h3>Another example</h3>
    <p>
      And here, we created an object, we used the forEach() method to console
      log a string that includes the keys and values of each pair in the object.
    </p>
    <p>But also that we can do the same with another for of loop!</p>
