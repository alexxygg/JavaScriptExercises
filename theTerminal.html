    <title>The Terminal</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>The Terminal</h1>
    <p>
      We can interact with our computer through the terminal instead of the GUI.
    </p>
    <p>Why it matters:</p>
    <p>Speed, it can be much faster than the GUI.(NO CLICKING,DRAGGING,ETC.)</p>
    <p>
      Access, we get access to areas we normally can't interact with or are
      hidden from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tools, many of them are installed through the terminal, not much choice.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      The terminal is a text-based interface to our computer. (The actual
      application.)
    </p>
    <p>It was originally a physical object, now a software.</p>
    <p>
      A shell is the program running on the terminal. (An ATM is the terminal,
      and the software each bank uses is each shell.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bash is a popular shell, the default on Mac in the past. We can change
      between shells on our terminals.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Commands</h2>
    <h3>ls , list</h3>
    <p>
      We are in the default directory when we open a new terminal, it is our
      Home (~ is the shortcut.).
    </p>
    <p>
      With ls, we can list all the directories and/or files in our current
      location.
    </p>
    <h3>pwd (Print Working directory)</h3>
    <p>It tells us exactly where we are in our files.</p>
    <h3>cd (change directory)</h3>
    <p>We use this command to move into or back out to a folder/file.</p>
    <p>We need to specify where we are trying to go with a path.</p>
    <p>Tab will auto-complete our path if it matches anything.</p>
    <p>cd.. will take us backwards one step.</p>

    <h3>Absolute vs Relative paths</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      With a relative path, we can only access a specified path moving into or
      forward if the file is available relative to where we currently are.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If dogs has a file inside it called germanShepard, we can only access it
        if we are ALREADY inside the dogs folder.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>With an absolute path, we can go anywhere else, also moving forward.</p>
    <p>If we are outside dogs, we can specify an absolute path.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If we are in animals, we can access germanShepard with:</li>
      <li>cd /dogs/germanShepard</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>mkdir (make directory)</h3>
    <p>It will create a new folder wherever we are in the file path.</p>
    <p>
      The name of the folder is followed by the command, just separated by a
      space.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is a folder with the same name as the one we are trying to
      create, we will be told so.
    </p>
    <p>It can be combined with .. and ../.. , etc.</p>
    <h3>man (Manual)</h3>
    <p>It provides information about the different commands.</p>
    <h3>Flags</h3>
    <p>
      They are options and parameters to specify how we want the command to run,
      what info to display, the order,etc.
    </p>
    <p>They start with a dash.</p>
    <ul>
      Examples:
      <li>
        ls -a shows us all entries, including hidden filles which begin with a
        dot/period.
      </li>
      <li>-l gives more details.</li>
      <li>-la does both things (THEY CAN BE COMBINED!)</li>
      <li>
        mkdir -v tells us what was created, instead of doing it silently like
        normal.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can exit by typing q.</p>
    <h3>touch</h3>
    <p>
      It helps us create a file, in contrast to mkdir, which creates a folder or
      directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's primary use is making a new file, but it is originally to change file
      access or modification times (Last modified update).
    </p>
    <p>If we use touch on an existing file it will do just that.</p>
    <p>We can specify the type of file, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>touch newDoc.html</li>
      <li>touch newDoc.html</li>
      <li>touch newDoc.html</li>
      <li>(OR --> touch newDoc.html newDoc.html newDoc.html)</li>
      <li>man touch (opens the manual for the touch command :D)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>We can clear the terminal with clear or Ctrl L on Linux.</p>
    <p>cd .. takes us one directory back.</p>
    <p>cd ../.. takes us two directories back.</p>
    <p>
      cd ../../something takes us to a directory 2 levels outside, but inside
      that particular level.
    </p>
    <p>cd ~ takes us home from wherever we are.</p>
