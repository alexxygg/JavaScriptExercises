    <h1>const variable used for arrays</h1>
    <p>
      We can use a const for our array variable, while still adding, removing
      and modifying the content inside the array. IT WORKS:
    </p>
    <p>const array = ["one","two"];</p>
    <p>array.push("three");</p>
    <p>array;</p>
    <p>["one","two","three"];</p>
    <p>
      What we can not do is modify the array as an element. We can not change
      the array to a number or a string, as it was set as an array in the first
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can not even change an array by updating it to the exact values, since
      JS would now see it as a different reference.
    </p>
    <p>const array = ["one","two"];</p>
    <p>array = ["one","two"];</p>
    <p>ERROR!!!</p>
    <p>
      That woud create 2 arrays, which is impossible since we set our array to
      be a constant variable, it can not be changed!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is good because we can rely that our array container will be the
      same.
    </p>

      We can renovate inside the house, but not change all the walls and roof.
