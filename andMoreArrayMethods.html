    <h1>And More Array Methods</h1>
    <h2>.slice()</h2>
    <p>This method helps us grab a slice of an array, or slice it.</p>
    <p>It takes a starting point and an ending point which is optional.</p>
    <p>
      The starting point alone will include the inde we enter and go all the way
      to the end of the array.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering both a starting and ending point is different, the ending point
      index will not be included in our returning sliced array!
    </p>
    <p>
      If we do not pass any points, (leave it blank), it will create a copy of
      the array.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever we slice will not affect the original array, it will be
      unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can even enter a negative index, it would return that number starting
      from the end of the array, in a reverse order.
    </p>

    <h2>.splice()</h2>
    <p>
      The splice method helps us do many things, this method is destructive, so
      it will actually change the array we are workking with.
    </p>
    <h3>Deleting items</h3>
    <p>First we will use it to delete an array index.</p>
    <p>
      We will need the starting index, which would be the index of the item we
      want to delete. And the number of items we are deleting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of deleting 1 item, 3 items and starting at one index
      all the way to the end.

    <h3>Adding items</h3>
    <p>
      We can also add items to our array as needed, it uses the same syntax, but
      we need to include the item as an argument in our .splice() method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we add one item, first we enter the index where we want our new item
      to be, specifying that we do not want to delete any items (The 0). And
      then our array item.
    </p>
    <img src="spliceAddNoDelete.png" alt="" />
    <p>But we can also add multiple items at the same time.</p>
    <img src="spliceAddMultipleNoDelete.png" alt="" />
    <p>Or delete multiple and add one.</p>

    <h2>.sort()</h2>
    <p>This one helps us sort items in an array.</p>
    <p>
      By default it does not really sort say an array of numbers, we can use
      functions for this.
    </p>
