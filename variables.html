    <h1>Variables</h1>
    <p>They help us resuse our code.</p>
    <p>
      It is like giving your value a label, we store a name for it to come back
      to it when needed.
    </p>
    <p>let someName = value;</p>
    <p>let year = 1985;</p>
    <p>let myLuckyNumber = 37;</p>
    <p>let octopusLimbs = 8;</p>
    <h2>Retrieving varlues</h2>
    <p>let numShoePairs = 20</p>
    <p>let numSocks = 50</p>
    <p>let feetThings = numShoePairs + numSocks</p>
    <p>
      If we multiple numShoePairs by 5, the result would be 100. But if we check
      the value of numShoePairs afterwards, the value would still be 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we can play with changing the values of any of the variables we made,
      but the result would not be updated. numSocks + 5 would result in 55, but
      checking numSocks after would only show 50.
    </p>

    <h2>Updating variable values</h2>
    <p>We can change numShoePairs to 40 in various ways.</p>
    <p>We can declare numShoePairs = 40;</p>
    <p>We can declare numShoePairs = numShoePairs + 20;</p>
    <p>
      Checking the value of numShoePairs after doing one of the above would give
      us 40 now!
    </p>
    <h3>
      Checking the value of feetThings would not give us an updated value of
      numShoePairs + numSocks, it would return the value we stored at the time
      it was declared only. So although numShoePairs is 40 now, and numSocks is
      50, we would not get 90 back, we would get 70. The value would not update
      unless done manually. We can simply declare the variable again: let
      feetThings = numShoePairs + numSocks; and now feetThings would result in
      90!
    </h3>
    <h2>Shorthands for updating a value.</h2>
    <p>
      We can also increment, reduce, multiple and divide with the shorthands:
    </p>
    <h3>variable += 1;</h3>
    <p>let numLives = 9;</p>
    <p>numLives += 5</p>
    <p>Now numLives has a value of 14!</p>

    <p>let numLives = 9;</p>
    <p>numLives -= 5</p>
    <p>Now numLives has a value of 4!</p>

    <p>let numLives = 9;</p>
    <p>numLives *= 5</p>
    <p>Now numLives has a value of 45!</p>

    <p>let numLives = 9;</p>
    <p>numLives /= 5</p>
    <p>Now numLives has a value of 1.8!</p>
    <hr />
    <p>let bankBalance = 100;</p>
    <p>bankBalance /= 2;</p>
    <p>bankBalance += 10;</p>
    <p>Now bankBalance has a value of 60!</p>

    <h3>variable ++ and variable --</h3>
    <p>This shorthand is useful for changing the value by 1.</p>
    <p>let score = 20;</p>
    <p>score++;</p>
    <p>score now has a value of 21!</p>
    <p>let coins = 35;</p>
    <p>coins --;</p>
    <p>coins now has a value of 34!</p>
