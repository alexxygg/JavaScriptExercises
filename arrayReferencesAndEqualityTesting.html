    <h1>References and Equality Testing</h1>
    <p>
      When trying to compare two array sets or specific values, it will always
      return false.
    </p>
    <p>An array variable is only a reference to the set of values.</p>
    <p>["hey"] === ["hey"];</p>
    <p>false</p>

    <p>
      They can not be compared because they are only referencing the array, it
      is not the same array.
    </p>
    <p>If we are to create an exact copy, we can have it result in true.</p>
    <p>Here we created a variable for an array.</p>
    <p>
      Then we gave the variable another name additional to the first one, so the
      reference is still the same, they are pointing to the exact same array
      this time.
